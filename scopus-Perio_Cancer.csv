Aim: To study the effects of the estrogen antagonist tamoxifen (TAM) on periodontal disease of oncological patients; clinical oral strains of C. albicans. Patients: With periodontitis and breast cancer and other with AIDS were used. Materials & methods: Periodontal disease was evaluated by the academy of periodontology procedures and the growth of clinical C. albicans isolates were evaluated by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute techniques. Results: Women who consumed TAM for more than 2 years decreased periodontitis severity. In vitro, TAM inhibited the growth of both fluconazole-sensitive and resistant C. albicans. Conclusion: Administered TAM chronically improves periodontal health and has antifungal activity on oral strains isolated from patients with odontologic and medical pathologies. © 2019 2019 Future Medicine Ltd.","antifungal; antitumoral; azoles; breast cancer; Candida albicans; immunocompromise; periodontal disease; resistance; tamoxifen","Antifungal Agents; Antitussive Agents; Azoles; Breast Neoplasms; Candida albicans; Estrogens; Female; Fluconazole; Humans; Immunocompromised Host; Periodontal Diseases; Periodontal Pocket; Periodontitis; Tamoxifen; fluconazole; tamoxifen; antifungal agent; antitussive agent; estrogen; fluconazole; pyrrole derivative; tamoxifen; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; antifungal activity; antifungal resistance; antifungal susceptibility; Article; breast cancer; cancer hormone therapy; cancer patient; Candida albicans; controlled study; disease severity; female; fungal strain; fungus growth; fungus isolation; growth inhibition; human; IC50; in vitro study; in vivo study; long term care; major clinical study; nonhuman; oropharynx candidiasis; periodontitis; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Prevotella intermedia; priority journal; treatment duration; breast tumor; Candida albicans; complication; drug effect; immunocompromised patient; isolation and purification; microbiology; pathogenicity; periodontal disease; periodontal pocket; periodontitis","","fluconazole, 86386-73-4; tamoxifen, 10540-29-1; Antifungal Agents, ; Antitussive Agents, ; Azoles, ; Estrogens, ; Fluconazole, ; Tamoxifen, ","","","","","Reynaud A.H., Nygaard-Ostby B., Boygard G.K., Et al., Yeasts in periodontal pockets, J.

We enrolled 683,854 participants, comparing cancer incidence among those with and without periodontitis and assessing the impact of periodontal treatment on cancer risk. Regardless of gender, age, Charlson comorbidity index, or the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, periodontitis patients had a lower overall cancer risk than controls. However, men with periodontitis had a higher risk of prostate cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10–1.35), and both men and women had a higher risk of thyroid cancer (women: aHR = 1.20, 95%CI = 1.04–1.38; men: aHR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.15–1.99). Patients with periodontitis who received treatment showed a reduced cancer risk (aHR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.38–0.44) compared to untreated patients. Proper treatment for periodontitis may lower an individual’s cancer risk more than if they did not have the disease at all, suggesting that periodontitis is a modifiable risk factor for cancer. © 2023 by the authors.","inflammation; periodontal therapy; periodontitis; prostate cancer; thyroid cancer","","","","","","Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare Clinical Trial Center, (MOHW111-TDU-B-212-134004); China Medical University Hospital, CMUH, (DMR-110-111, DMR-110-224, DMR-111-105, DMR-111-114, DMR-111-230, DMR-112-219); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (109-2314-B-039-018-MY3)","This study is supported in part by the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare Clinical Trial Center (MOHW111-TDU-B-212-134004), the Minister of Science and Technology, Taiwan (109-2314-B-039-018-MY3), and the China Medical University Hospital (DMR-110-111, DMR-110-224, DMR-111-105, DMR-111-114, DMR-111-230, and DMR-112-219).","Ma K.S., Lai J.N., Thota E., Yip H.T., Chin N.C., Wei J.C., Van Dyke T.E., Bidirectional Relationship Between Osteoarthritis and Periodontitis: A Population-Based Cohort Study over a 15-year Follow-Up, Front.

Periodontal disease (PD) is a chronic inflammatory disease that leads to alveolar bone resorption and tooth loss. Many studies have reported the association between periodontal disease and various cancers including oral cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer and so on. However, there is still no specialized meta-analysis that assesses the association between periodontal disease and cancer incidence and mortality indeepth. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis. Methods. This meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO: CRD42020183497. We searched five online databases for observational studies about the association between periodontal disease and breast, prostate, lung and bronchial, colorectal, and total cancers by July 2020. Then we evaluated quality of the included studies by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Risk ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled to evaluate the strength of the association between periodontal disease and four cancers, total cancer incidence and mortality. In addition, we analyzed heterogeneity by subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. Finally, we inspected publication bias by Begg's and Egger's tests. Results. None of the studies included in this meta-analysis were of poor quality. PD is not only related to breast cancer incidence (HR = 1.26, 95%CI [1.11-1.43], I2 = 75.8%, P = 0.000), but also connected with total cancer mortality (HR = 1.40, 95%CI [1.24-1.58], I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.718). Subgroup analyses showed that study population, study design, dental status, follow-up period, adjustment for smoking partially explained the heterogeneity between studies. The results of Begg's test and Egger's test were consistent and indicated that there is no publication bias in this study. Conclusion. In conclusion, this meta-analysis revealed a positive relationship between periodontal disease and breast cancer incidence and total cancer mortality. Further well-designed studies with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are required to strengthen the conclusion of this meta-analysis. However, longer follow-up period, multi-center trials and even multinational studies are required to corroborate the results.

Methods: This study was literature review study, pubmed searching was used to find scientific article about association of periodontal disease and prostate cancer. Results: Direct correlation between periodontal disease and prostrate cancer is still unclear. It was hyphotesized that microorganisms involved in chronic periodontitis may directly induce mutations in the tumor-suppresor genes and proto-oncogenes or alter the signalling pathways that in turn stimulates cancer growth.

This perspective article hypothesizes that the determinant mediating the association of periodontal disease with cancer is dysregulated phosphate metabolism. Phosphate, an essential dietary micronutrient, is dysregulated in chronic kidney disease, and both cancer and periodontal disease are associated with chronic kidney disease. Reviewed evidence includes the association between phosphate toxicity and cancer development, and the association between periodontal disease and chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder includes conditions such as ectopic calcification and bone resorption, which may be indirectly related to periodontal disease. Dental calculus in periodontal disease contains calcium phosphate crystals that are deposited from excess calcium and phosphate in saliva. Alveolar bone resorption may be linked systemically to release of parathyroid hormone in response to hypocalcemia induced by hyperphosphatemia. More research is needed to examine the role of dysregulated phosphate metabolism in periodontal disease. © 2019 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

A great number of studies suggest that periodontitis and oral cancer are linked, however it is unclear if specific periodontal bacteria promote the development of systemic illness. The mediators of the relationship between those two pathologies are still being discovered, but the research findings indicate the existence of a correlation. Additional research, including confounding factors, is needed to strengthen this link. © 2021 by the authors.

Its main objectives are as follows: (1) preventing and reducing adverse events, (2) maintaining or improving nutritional status, (3) improving cancer treatment outcomes, (4) maintaining or improving quality of life, (5) providing high quality medical care through comprehensive oral care, (6) controlling odontogenic foci of infection, and (7) maintaining or improving oral function. A literature search was conducted using the electronic databases of Medical Journal and PubMed. Electronic database searches were performed using various combinations of the following key words: cancer, surgery, treatment, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and dental disease, oral care, oral management, dental intervention, oral health, dental care, and dental management. The selection of literature for inclusion in the review was restricted to dental management of patients receiving cancer treatment. In the course of the literature review, hand searches were also added as needed. The guideline was developed by summarizing the results of the review. Based on a review of the literature on the management of dental foci of infection in the oral functional management of patients undergoing cancer treatment, a guideline was developed by summarizing the results of the review.

Experimental animal models are critical tools to investigate the effects and mechanisms of periodontitis on colorectal cancer. Several murine periodontitis models have been used in research, including oral gavage, periodontal pathogen injection, and ligature models. The role of experimental periodontitis caused by silk ligation in colorectal cancer remains unclear. In this study, we used an experimental periodontitis model on a colitis-associated colorectal cancer model and a spontaneous model, respectively. We observed the promotion of colorectal cancer in ligature-induced periodontitis mice compared to those control mice in 2 different models, as assessed by tumor number, tumor size, and tumor load. Since bacterial dysbiosis is an important feature of periodontitis, we next analyzed the oral and gut microbiomes using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. We found that the experimental periodontitis model reshaped the microbial community in the oral cavity and gut. In addition, we found a higher extent of programmed death 1 (PD-1)–positive CD8+ T-cell infiltration in tumor samples of the periodontitis group than in controls by immunofluorescence staining. Regarding the potential molecular mechanism, we transplanted the fecal microbiota of the periodontitis patient into mice and observed a tumor-promoting effect in the periodontitis group, assessed by tumor volume and tumor weight, together with a low level of INF-γ+ CD8+ T-cell infiltration in subcutaneous tumor mice. Taken together, we show that ligature-induced periodontitis model promotes colorectal cancer by microbiota remodeling and suppression of the immune response. © International Association for Dental Research and American Association for Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research 2023.","16S rRNA; bacteria; colorectal neoplasms; immunity; intestines; mouth","Animals; Bacteria; Colorectal Neoplasms; Disease Models, Animal; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Periodontitis; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; RNA 16S; animal; bacterium; C57BL mouse; colorectal tumor; complication; disease model; genetics; intestine flora; microbiology; mouse; periodontitis","","RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, ","","","Zhejiang Province Public Welfare Technology, (LGD21H 160002); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (82170992); Health Commission of Zhejiang Province, (2023578693)","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 82170992, to M.S.

However, most studies reporting an association between OC and periodontal disease have used different clinical and radiographic criteria to define periodontal disease. This review aimed to evaluate the currently available evidence to determine an association between periodontal disease (extension and severity), OC, and oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs). Material and methods: A systematic search of studies published up to August 2018 was performed following the PRISMA guidelines in the electronic databases MEDLINE (PubMed) and COCHRANE (OVID). A methodological evaluation was made using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist. Results: Eight studies (case-control, cross-sectional and cohort) were included. An increased clinical attachment loss, plaque index, bleeding on probing, and radiographic bone loss was found in patients with OC and OPMDs. Differences in the methodological characteristics, case definition used for periodontal diseases, and OC location did not allow estimating the odds ratio required to conduct a meta-analysis. Conclusion: Some studies suggest a positive relationship between periodontal disease, OC, and OPMDs; however, the currently available evidence is insufficient to draw solid conclusions. © 2020 Acta Odontologica Scandinavica Society.","Oral cancer; oral potentially malignant disorders; periodontal diseases; periodontitis","Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Mouth Neoplasms; Periodontal Diseases; Periodontitis; case control study; complication; cross-sectional study; human; mouth tumor; periodontal disease; periodontitis","","","","","","","Bray F., Ferlay J., Soerjomataram I., Et al., A.

It is difficult to imagine a testing method less invasive than measurement of salivary metabolites by swab or spit. Coupling data from this incredibly convenient measurement to an automated decision-making engine can provide clinicians with immediate feedback on the status of their patients. The aim of this research is to lay the foundation for a system, which when employed in dental practices can help to stratify between patients with periodontitis and oral cancers and illuminate metabolic networks important to both diseases. We built machine learning models trained on QSAR descriptors of metabolites whose concentrations changed drastically between the two diseases and used these same metabolites to illuminate networks important in the development of each disease. The Neural Network developed in TensorFlow performed best, achieving 81.29% classification accuracy between metabolites of periodontitis and oral cancers, respectively. We compared effects of two attribute selection methods, ranking by Correlation and Information Gain coefficients, on the accuracy of the models and employed principal component analysis to the data for dimensionality reduction before training. Models trained on attributes ranked by Information Gain coefficients regularly outperformed those ranked by Correlation coefficients across machine learning methods while relying on fewer principal components. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Biomarkers; Deep learning; Diagnostics; Machine learning; Metabolic networks; Metabolomics; Oral cancer; Periodontitis","Biomolecules; Computational chemistry; Decision making; Diagnosis; Dimensionality reduction; Diseases; Intelligent systems; Metabolites; Noninvasive medical procedures; Testing; Automated decision making; Classification accuracy; Correlation coefficient; Immediate feedbacks; Machine learning methods; Machine learning models; Non-invasive diagnostics; Principal Components; Learning systems","","","","","","","Li B., Meng M.Q., Tumor recognition in wireless capsule endoscopy images using textural features and SVM-based feature selection, IEEE Trans.

To identify the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation regulator genes linking prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and periodontitis (PD). Materials and Methods. PD and TCGA-PRAD GEO datasets were downloaded and analyzed through differential expression analysis to determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) deregulated in both conditions. Twenty-three m6A RNA methylation-related genes were downloaded in total. The m6A-related genes that overlapped between PRAD and PD were identified as crosstalk genes. Survival analysis was performed on these genes to determine their prognostic values in the overall survival outcomes of prostate cancer. The KEGG pathways were the most significantly enriched by m6A-related crosstalk genes. We also performed lasso regression analysis and univariate survival analysis to identify the most important m6A-related crosstalk genes, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built from these genes. Results. Twenty-three m6A methylation-related regulator genes were differentially expressed and deregulated in PRAD and PD. Among these, seven (i.e., ALKBH5, FMR1, IGFBP3, RBM15B, YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and ZC3H13) were identified as m6A-related cross-talk genes. Survival analysis showed that only the FMR1 gene was a prognostic indicator for PRAD. All other genes had no significant influence on the overall survival of patients with PRAD. Lasso regression analysis and univariate survival analysis identified four m6A-related cross-talk genes (i.e., ALKBH5, IGFBP3, RBM15B, and FMR1) that influenced risk levels. A PPI network was constructed from these genes, and 183 genes from this network were significantly enriched in pathogenic Escherichia coli infection, p53 signaling pathway, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Conclusion. Seven m6A methylation-related genes (ALKBH5, FMR1, IGFBP3, RBM15B, YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and ZC3H13) were identified as cross-talk genes between prostate cancer and PD. © 2022 Dexin Ding et al.","","Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein;

The genes related to both breast cancer and periodontitis were determined by text mining. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis were performed on these genes, and protein-protein interaction analysis was carried out to export significant module genes. Drug-gene interaction database was employed for potential drug discovery. We identified 221 genes common to both breast cancer and periodontitis. The top six significant enrichment terms and 15 enriched signal pathways were selected. Among 24 significant genes demonstrated as a gene cluster, we found SERPINA1 and TF were significantly related to poor overall survival between the relatively high and low groups in patients. Using the final two genes, 12 drugs were identified that had potential therapeutic effects. SERPINA1 and TF were screened out as essential genes related to both breast cancer and periodontitis, targeting 12 candidate drugs that may expand drug indications. Drug discovery using text mining and analysis of different databases can promote the identification of existing drugs that have the potential of administration to improve treatment in breast cancer. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Oral health is important and directly related to the overall general health of the body; it is dependent and related to oral health knowledge and oral hygiene behavior. Several studies have associated links between BC and periodontal disease (PD). The aim of the study was to assess oral health and periodontal disease awareness and potential risk factors of BC in a sample of Jeddah residents. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 106 adults with a self-answered questionnaire in the framework of a community service initiative sponsored by the Ministry of Health on the occasion of the world BC month, where the college students participated in. Results: In our study population, 68.68% of participants expressed proper oral hygiene awareness, while merely 42.72% identified the correct risk factors of BC. Only 12.3% had awareness of PD as a potential risk factor of BC, and their awareness was measured against their oral hygiene and periodontal health awareness, where 92.3% acknowledged the negative effect of oral hygiene neglect on the overall body health, 76.9% heard of dental plaque biofilm, and only 23.1% identified it as the causative of PD. Finally, 61.5% cleaned their teeth twice a day in accordance with the recommendations of the Saudi Dental Society. Conclusion: There is an urgent need for comprehensive educational programs to promote correct oral hygiene practice and educate on its positive impact on the overall body health. The knowledge and awareness on BC and PD can still rise by community services and awareness campaigns throughout the city of Jeddah. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Methods: Forty patients were allocated into the periodontitis group (P) (n = 20) and breast cancer with periodontitis group (BC/P) (n = 20). Two days before the removal of infectious foci from the oral cavity and NSPT, as well as periodontal reevaluations, C-reactive protein, neutrophils (103μL), and platelets (103μL), were evaluated. The following cytokines in GCF, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-2, IL-6, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) were evaluated by the Luminex assay at baseline, and 45 and 180 days after therapy. Cytokine levels were analyzed for correlations with the clinical parameters: clinical attachment level (CAL), probing depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP), and plaque index (PI). Results: After NSPT, IL-2, TNF-α, and TGF-β were downregulated (p<0.05) in the BC/P. In the P group, INF-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α were downregulated (p<0.05), and TGF-β was increased (p<0.05). At 180 days, IL-6 in GCF was significantly positively correlated with PD and CAL (r=0.45, r=0.56) in the BC/P (p<0.05). In the P group, IL-1β in GCF was positively correlated with PD and CAL (r=0.56, r=0.59) at 45 days (p<0.05). Conclusion: NSPT, before the start of chemotherapy, helps to reduce the inflammatory markers associated with the activity of periodontal disease, favoring a less inflammatory pattern, to avoid the exacerbation of periodontitis. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Breast cancer; Cytokines; Periodontal therapy; Periodontitis","Breast Neoplasms; Cytokines; Female; Gingival Crevicular Fluid; Humans; Periodontitis; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; antineoplastic agent; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 2; interleukin 6; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor; cytokine; tumor necrosis factor; adult; Article; bleeding; blood sampling; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; clinical article; controlled study; correlation analysis; female; gingivitis; human; human cell; neutrophil; periodontal disease; periodontitis; plaque index; breast tumor; chemistry; gingivitis","","gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; interleukin 2, 85898-30-2; Cytokines, ; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, ","","","Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2012/20971-8); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, (001)","This study was financed by the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) grants 2012/20971-8 and in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001.

The aim of the current meta-analysis was to quantitatively assess this relationship in order to determine whether this represents a true risk factor, with implications for cancer prevention and management. PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases were systematically searched. Selective studies were reviewed, and meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on eligible studies using a random effects model. In total, 21 eligible observational studies (4 cohorts and 17 case-controls) were identified for qualitative synthesis after a review of 1051 articles. Significant heterogeneity could be identified in measures utilized for reporting of periodontal disease. Meta-analysis performed on nine studies that employed objective measures for reporting periodontal disease demonstrated a significant association between periodontal disease and HNC [OR 3.17, 95% CI, 1.78–5.64]. A diseased periodontium represents an independent risk marker, and a putative risk factor, for HNC. Prospective studies with standardized measures of periodontal disease severity and extent, integrated with microbiological and host susceptibility facets, are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of this positive association and whether treatment of the former influences the incidence and outcomes for HNC. © 2020 by the authors.

And periodontal pathogens, leading to periodontal diseases development, may serve a crucial role in oral cancer. This review elucidated the molecular mechanisms of periodontal pathogens in oral cancer. The pathogens directly engage in their own unique molecular dialogue with the host epithelium to acquire cancer phenotypes, and indirectly induce a proinflammatory environment and carcinogenic substance in favor of cancer development. And functional, rather than compositional, properties of oral microbial community correlated with cancer development are discussed. The effect of periodontal pathogens on periodontal diseases and oral cancer will further detail the pathogenesis of oral cancer and intensify the need of maintaining oral hygiene for the prevention of oral diseases including oral cancer.

Materials and methods: We performed a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using publicly released genome-wide association studies (GWAS) statistics. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the primary analysis. We applied complementary methods, including weighted median, weighted mode, simple mode, MR-Egger regression, and MR-pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) to detect and correct for the effect of horizontal pleiotropy. Results: IVW MR analysis showed no effect of periodontitis on breast cancer (IVW OR=0.99, P =0.14). Similarly, no significant causal relationship between breast cancer and periodontitis was found in reverse MR analysis (IVW OR=0.95, P =0.83). The results of MR-Egger regression, weighted median, and weighted mode methods were consistent with those of the IVW method. Based on sensitivity analyses, horizontal pleiotropy is unlikely to distort causal estimates. Conclusions: Although observational studies have reported an association between periodontitis and breast cancer, the results of our MR analysis do not support a causal relationship between periodontitis and breast cancer. Clinical relevance: Mendelian randomization study can more clearly analyze the causal relationship between periodontitis and breast cancer, in order to provide a certain reference for clinicians and deepen the understanding of the relationship between periodontitis and breast cancer, to explore more possible associations between periodontitis and systemic diseases. © 2023, The Author(s).","Breast cancer; GWAS; Mendelian randomization; Periodontitis","Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Neoplasms; Periodontitis; genetics; genome-wide association study; human; Mendelian randomization analysis; neoplasm; periodontitis","","","","","Science and Technology Fund of Guizhou Provincial Health Commission, (gzwkj2021-341)","This work was supported by the Science and Technology Fund of Guizhou Provincial Health Commission (gzwkj2021-341).

The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between periodontitis and oral hygiene habits and upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) cancers. Study Design: We conducted a case-control study, which included 240 UADT cancer cases and 240 controls matched by gender and age (±5 years) from 2 different hospitals in Pune, India. In-person interviews and intraoral examinations were conducted for all patients. Results: Severe periodontitis and greater than 5 missing teeth were associated with a significant risk of UADT cancers (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–4.91; adjusted OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.95–5.49). Among the self-reported oral hygiene habits, dental checkups only at the time of pain was associated with an elevated risk for UADT cancers (adjusted OR 4.12; 95% CI 2.63–6.47). Topical application of mishri (black powder obtained by roasting and grinding tobacco) on gums (adjusted OR 3.06; 95% CI 1.75–5.35) and toothbrushing frequency less than once daily; (adjusted OR 2.09; 95% CI 1.27–3.45) were also associated with an elevated risk. Furthermore, the habit of ever chewing tobacco was associated with an elevated risk of severe periodontitis. Conclusions: Severe periodontitis is associated with an elevated risk for UADT cancers, and tobacco chewing strengthens this association in this population. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","","Adult; Case-Control Studies; Habits; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; India; Oral Hygiene; Periodontitis; Risk Factors; adult; case control study; habit; head and neck tumor; human; India; mouth hygiene; periodontitis; risk factor","","","","","","","Gupta B., Johnson N.W., Kumar N., Global epidemiology of head and neck cancers: a continuing challenge, Oncology, 91, pp. 13-23, (2016); Bray F., Ferlay J., Soerjomataram I., Siegel R.L., Torre L.A., Jemal A., Global cancer statistics 2018: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries, CA Cancer J Clin, 68, pp. 394-424, (2018); Gupta B., Johnson N.W., Emerging and established global life-style risk factors for cancer of the upper aero-digestive tract, Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, 15, pp. 5983-5991, (2014); Laprise C., Shahul H.P., Madathil S.A., Et al., Periodontal diseases and risk of oral cancer in Southern India: results from the HeNCe Life study, Int J Cancer, 139, pp. 1512-1519, (2016); Meyer M.S., Joshipura K., Giovannucci E., Michaud D.S., A review of the relationship between tooth loss, periodontal disease, and cancer, Cancer Causes Control, 19, pp. 895-907, (2008); Johnson N.W., Gupta B., Speicher D.J., Et al., Etiology and risk factors, Oral and Oropharyngeal Cancer: Causes, Prevention and Management of Malignancies of the Mouth and Oropharynx, pp. 19-93, (2018); Gupta B., Ariyawardana A., Johnson N.W., Oral cancer in India continues in epidemic proportions: evidence base and policy initiatives, Int Dent J, 63, pp. 12-25, (2013); Caton J.G., Armitage G., Berglundh T., Et al., A new classification scheme for periodontal and peri‐implant diseases and conditions—introduction and key changes from the 1999 classification, J Periodontol, 89, pp. S1-S8, (2018); Pihlstrom B.L., Michalowicz B.S., Johnson N.W., Periodontal diseases, Lancet, 366, pp. 1809-1820, (2005); Migliorati C.A., Periodontal diseases and cancer, Lancet Oncol, 9, pp. 510-512, (2008); Al-Hebshi N.N., Borgnakke W.S., Johnson N.W., The microbiome of oral squamous cell carcinomas: a functional perspective, Curr Oral Health Rep, 6, pp. 145-160, (2019); Javed F., Warnakulasuriya S., Is there a relationship between periodontal disease and oral cancer?

Materials and methods: Patients diagnosed with periodontal diseases at Hacettepe University between 2007 and 2012 were included and data on the diagnosis of any cancer after periodontal disease were collected from patient files. The age- and sex-standardized incidence rates (SIRs) were calculated using Turkish National Cancer Registry 2013 data. Results: A total of 5199 patients were included. Median follow-up was 7.2 years. Patients with periodontal diseases had 17% increased risk of cancer compared with the expected counts for the corresponding age and sex groups (SIR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.04–1.3, P = 0.006). The increased cancer risk was statistically significant in women (SIR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.05–1.45, P = 0.008) but not in men. Among women with periodontal disease, the risks of breast cancer (SIR: 2.19) and head and neck cancer (SIR: 4.71) were significantly increased. Among men, the risks of prostate cancer (SIR: 1.84), head and neck cancer (SIR: 3.55), and hematological cancers (SIR: 1.76) were significantly increased. Conclusion: This study showed that periodontal diseases were associated with increased risk of several cancers. Besides other wellknown benefits for health, the provision of oral/dental health should be considered and employed as a cancer prevention measure. © TÜBİTAK.","Breast cancer; Cancer risk; Periodontal disease; Prostate cancer","Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Periodontal Diseases; Risk Factors; Turkey; adult; Article; bladder cancer; breast cancer; cancer prevention; cancer registry; cancer risk; colorectal cancer; confidence interval; dental health; female; follow up; head and neck cancer; hematologic malignancy; human; incidence; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; overall survival; pancreas cancer; periodontal disease; prostate cancer; risk assessment; stomach cancer; cohort analysis; complication; middle aged; neoplasm; periodontal disease; risk factor; turkey (bird)","","","","","","","Lauritano D., Sbordone L., Nardone M., Iapichino A., Scapoli L., Et al., Focus on periodontal disease and colorectal carcinoma, ORAL & Implantology, 10, 3, pp. 229-233, (2017); Pihlstrom B.L., Michalowicz B.S., Johnson N.W., Periodontal diseases, Lancet, 366, 9499, pp. 1809-1820, (2005); Hajishengallis G., Periodontitis: From microbial immune subversion to systemic inflammation, Nature Reviews Immunology, 15, 1, pp. 30-44, (2015); Mai X., Genco R.J., Lamonte M.J., Hovey K.M., Freudenheim J.L., Et al., Periodontal pathogens and risk of incident cancer in postmenopausal females: The Buffalo OsteoPerio Study, Journal of Periodontology, 87, 3, pp. 257-267, (2016); Loos B.G., Systemic markers of inflammation in periodontitis, Journal of Periodontology, 76, Suppl. 11, pp. 2106-2115, (2005); Kim J., Amar S., Periodontal disease and systemic conditions: A bidirectional relationship, Odontology, 94, 1, pp. 10-21, (2006); Lee J.H., Kweon H.H., Choi J.K., Kim Y.T., Choi S.H., Association between periodontal disease and prostate cancer: Results of a 12-year longitudinal cohort study in South Korea, Journal of Cancer, 8, 15, pp. 2959-2965, (2017); Michaud D.S., Kelsey K.T., Papathanasiou E., Genco C.A., Giovannucci E., Periodontal disease and risk of all cancers among male never smokers: An updated analysis of the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, Annals of Oncology, 27, 5, pp. 941-947, (2016); Michaud D.S., Liu Y., Meyer M., Giovannucci E., Joshipura K., Periodontal disease, tooth loss and cancer risk in a prospective study of male health professionals, Lancet Oncology, 9, 6, pp. 550-558, (2008); Nwizu N.N., Marshall J.R., Moysich K., Genco R.J., Hovey K.M., Et al., Periodontal disease and incident cancer risk among postmenopausal women: Results from the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Cohort.

While information about the topic remains somewhat scarce, a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanistic pathways promoting neoplasia in periodontitis patients is of fundamental importance. This manuscript presents the literature as well as a panel of tables and figures on the molecular mechanisms of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, two main oral pathogens in periodontitis pathology, involved in instigating tumorigenesis. We also present evidence for potential links between the RANKL–RANK signaling axis as well as circulating cytokines/leukocytes and carcinogenesis. Due to the nonconclusive data associating periodontitis and cancer reported in the case and cohort studies, we examine clinical trials relevant to the topic and summarize their outcome. © 2022 by the authors.

Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.gingivalis) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F.nucleatum) are pathobiont related to periodontitis pathogenesis and were found to be abundant in the intestinal mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Besides, periodontal infections have been found in a variety of tissues and organs, indicating that periodontitis is not just an inflammation limited to the oral cavity. Considering the possible translocation of pathobiont from the oral cavity to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, this study aimed to review the published articles in this field to provide a comprehensive view of the existing knowledge about the relationship between periodontitis and GI malignancies by focusing on the oral/gut axis. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Federación de Sociedades Españolas de Oncología (FESEO).","Colorectal cancer;

Materials and methods: An electronic search in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was conducted using MeSH terms to identify cohort studies published before May 17, 2022. Cohort studies examining the association between PD and UC risk were included. We used a random-effects model to summarize the effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the included studies with PD as the indicator and UC as the outcome. Results: Eleven cohort studies met the inclusion criteria. Our results suggest that PD patients increases the risk of UC by 1.24-fold (hazard ratio (HR), 1.24; 95% CI, 1.17-1.31; I2, 22.4%). The strength of the sensitivity analysis and cumulative meta-analysis confirmed the reliability of the results. Conclusion: We found that PD is a potential risk factor for UC. Our results indicate that along with the decrease in the incidence of PD,PD treatment may help prevent UC. We hope that our study will raise awareness of periodontal health, thereby reducing the incidence of UC.

We hypothesized that the immune surveillance system is impaired in patients with periodontitis, which contributes to cancer development and growth. Therefore, the present study investigated the relationship between immune surveillance mechanisms and periodontitis in cancer patients. The presence or absence of periodontitis was assessed and the peripheral blood (PB) concentrations of IL-6, immunosuppressive cytokines (VEGF, TGF-β1, and CCL22) and proportion of T regulatory cells (Treg, CD3 + CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 +) were measured. Subjects were classified into the following four groups: non-cancer patients without periodontitis (C − P −), non-cancer patients with periodontitis (C − P +), cancer patients without periodontitis (C + P −), and cancer patients with periodontitis (C + P +). The results of a multivariate analysis showed that the PB concentration of IL-6 was significantly higher in C + than in C- and higher in C + P + than in C + P −. The PB proportion of Treg was significantly higher in C + P + than in C + P −, C − P + , and C − P −. The results of this study suggested that the presence of periodontitis and cancer synergistically increased Treg in PB, which may be one of the underlying causes of immunosuppression and immune evasion in cancer. It was also suggested that the presence of periodontal disease and/or cancer also increases IL-6 in PB, which would be associated with cancer progression. These results suggest the possibility that the presence of periodontitis might synergistically contribute to cancer progression. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Cytokines; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Humans; Immune Tolerance; Interleukin-6; Neoplasms; Neoplastic Processes; Periodontitis; T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory; cytokine; forkhead transcription factor; interleukin 6; complication; human; immunological tolerance; neoplasm; oncogenesis and malignant transformation; periodontitis; regulatory T lymphocyte","","Cytokines, ; Forkhead Transcription Factors, ; Interleukin-6, ","","","JPS, (JP21K16943)","This study was supported by JPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP21K16943.

Most recently, emerging evidence has suggested that chronic inflammatory diseases from the oral cavity (e.g., periodontal disease), to some extent, play a role in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The present study aimed to explore the direct impact of biofilm-induced periodontitis in the carcinogenesis process using a tobacco surrogate animal model for oral cancer. A total of 42 Wistar rats were distributed into four experimental groups: Control group, periodontitis (Perio) group, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO) group and 4NQO/Perio group. Periodontitis was stimulated by placing a ligature subgingivally, while oral carcinogenesis was induced by systemic administration of 4NQO in the drinking water for 20 weeks. It was observed that the Perio, 4NQO and 4NQO/Perio groups presented with significantly higher alveolar bone loss compared with that in the control group. Furthermore, all groups receiving 4NQO developed lesions on the dorsal surface of the tongue; however, the 4NQO/Perio group presented larger lesions compared with the 4NQO group. There was also a modest overall increase in the number of epithelial dysplasia and OSCC lesions in the 4NQO/Perio group. Notably, abnormal focal activation of cellular differentiation (cytokeratin 10-positive cells) that extended near the basal cell layer of the mucosa was observed in rats receiving 4NQO alone, but was absent in rats receiving 4NQO and presenting with periodontal disease. Altogether, the presence of periodontitis combined with 4NQO administration augmented tumor size in the current rat model and tampered with the protective mechanisms of the cellular differentiation of epithelial cells. © 2022 Spandidos Publications.

This study aimed to investigate whether chronic periodontitis is associated with cancer risk using a large, nationwide database. Methods: We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Cohort Database obtained between January 2003 and December 2015. We included 713,201 individuals without a history of cancer who were followed up to 10 years. Confounding factors included demographic factors (age, sex, income, and residential area), lifestyle behaviors (smoking history and BMI), and comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, and pulmonary disease, using the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was applied to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for cancer risk. Results: Of the 713,201 participants, 53,075 had periodontitis and were placed in the periodontitis group; the remaining 660,126 individuals were included as the control group. Overall, the cumulative incidence of cancer in the periodontitis group was 2.2 times higher than that in the control group. The periodontitis group had an increased risk of total cancer compared to the control group after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, BMI, and smoking history (aHR, 1.129; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.089-1.171; P<0.0001). When examining specific cancer types, significant associations were also observed between periodontitis and stomach cancer (aHR, 1.136; 95% CI, 1.042-1.239; P=0.0037), colon cancer (aHR, 1.129; 95% CI, 1.029-1.239; P=0.0105), lung cancer (aHR, 1.127; 95% CI, 1.008-1.260; P=0.0353), bladder cancer (aHR, 1.307; 95% CI, 1.071-1.595; P=0.0085), thyroid cancer (aHR, 1.191; 95% CI, 1.085-1.308; P=0.0002), and leukemia (aHR, 1.394; 95% CI, 1.039-1.872; P=0.0270). There was no significant association between the development of secondary malignancy and periodontitis in cancer survivors who were alive 5 years after they were diagnosed with the primary malignancy. Conclusions: Periodontal disease, including periodontitis, was associated with increased risk of cancer, which persisted after controlling for confounding factors. Further prospective research is warranted to establish a causal relationship.

A literature review was conducted to understand the possible association between them. Material and Methods: Articles published in the PubMed database from January 1999 and May 2020 were re-trieved. Limitations of the studies and biological mechanisms were discussed. Results: A total of 4,232 articles were found. Of these, 13 were analyzed according to inclusion criteria. Most pa-pers found some association between periodontitis and HNC, although differences in periodontal evaluation, sam-ple size, study design and tumor sites were observed. Porphyromonas gingivalis appears to increase the chance of both diseases, and it may be one of their main potential risk factors. Genetic predisposition is increased by exposure to environmental factors which can directly induce epigenetic changes that contribute to these diseases. Conclusions: Understanding the mechanisms related to periodontitis and HNC has increased, however, well-de-signed clinical studies are needed for better conclusions.

The associations between periodontal disease, tooth loss, and lung cancer risk remain debatable. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to evaluate whether periodontal disease and tooth loss are associated with lung cancer risk. Methods. A literature search was performed for relevant studies using PubMed and Embase databases. Risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was applied as effect size to summarize the associations between periodontal disease, tooth loss, and lung cancer risk. A further dose-response analysis was also performed. Results. A total of twelve studies comprising 263,238 participants were included. The results indicated that periodontal disease was positively associated with lung cancer risk (RR=1.37, 95%CI=1.16-1.63). There was a positive association between tooth loss and lung cancer risk (RR=1.69, 95%CI=1.46-1.96). Moreover, there was a significantly linear dose-response relationship between tooth loss and lung cancer risk, and every 5 increment in tooth loss was associated with 10% increased lung cancer risk. Similar results were obtained in subgroup analysis. Conclusions. Periodontal disease and tooth loss are increased risk factors for lung cancer. Prevention and treatment of periodontal disease may be effective potential prevention strategies for lung cancer. © 2020 You Chen et al.","","Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Periodontal Diseases; Risk Factors; Tooth Loss; Article; cancer prevention; cancer risk; clinical evaluation; dental prevention; disease association; Embase; human; lung cancer; lung carcinogenesis; Medline; periodontal disease; risk factor; systematic review; complication; lung tumor; periodontal disease","","","","","","","Bray F., Ferlay J., Soerjomataram I., Siegel R.L., Torre L.A., Jemal A., Global cancer statistics 2018: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries, CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, 68, 6, pp. 394-424, (2018); Youlden D.R., Cramb S.M., Baade P.D., The international epidemiology of lung cancer: Geographical distribution and secular trends, Journal of Thoracic Oncology: Official Publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, 3, 8, pp. 819-831, (2008); Kinane D.F., Stathopoulou P.G., Papapanou P.N., Periodontal diseases, Nature Reviews Disease Primers, 3, 1, (2017); Peres M.A., Macpherson L.M.D., Weyant R.J., Daly B., Venturelli R., Mathur M.R., Listl S., Celeste R.K., Guarnizo-Herreno C.C., Kearns C., Benzian H., Allison P., Watt R.G., Oral diseases: A global public health challenge, Lancet, 394, pp. 249-260, (2019); Zeng X.T., Deng A.P., Li C., Xia L.Y., Niu Y.M., Leng W.D., Periodontal disease and risk of head and neck cancer: A meta-analysis of observational studies, PloS One, 8, 10, (2013); Yao Q.W., Zhou D.S., Peng H.J., Ji P., Liu D.S., Association of periodontal disease with oral cancer: A meta-analysis, Tumor Biology, 35, 7, pp. 7073-7077, (2014); Ye L., Jiang Y., Liu W., Tao H., Correlation between periodontal disease and oral cancer risk: A meta-analysis, Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics, 12, Supplement 2, pp. C237-C240, (2016); Abnet C.C., Qiao Y.L., Mark S.D., Dong Z.W., Taylor P.R., Dawsey S.M., Prospective study of tooth loss and incident esophageal and gastric cancers in China, Cancer Causes & Control: CCC, 12, 9, pp. 847-854, (2001); Abnet C.C., Kamangar F., Dawsey S.M., Stolzenberg-Solomon R.Z., Albanes D., Pietinen P., Virtamo J., Taylor P.R., Tooth loss is associated with increased risk of gastric non-cardia adenocarcinoma in a cohort of Finnish smokers, Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology, 40, 6, pp. 681-687, (2009); Maisonneuve P., Amar S., Lowenfels A.B., Periodontal disease, edentulism, and pancreatic cancer: A meta-analysis, Annals of Oncology: Official Journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology, 28, 5, pp. 985-995, (2017); Lee J.-H., Kweon H.H.-I., Choi J.-K., Kim Y.-T., Choi S.-H., Association between periodontal disease and prostate cancer: Results of a 12-year longitudinal cohort study in South Korea, Journal of Cancer, 8, 15, pp. 2959-2965, (2017); Stang A., Critical evaluation of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for the assessment of the quality of nonrandomized studies in meta-analyses, European Journal of Epidemiology, 25, 9, pp. 603-605, (2010); Zhang J., Yu K.F., What's the relative risk?

Methods: To capture life course SES and its correlates, we generated a propensity score and included it, along with other potential confounders such as smoking and obesity, into a Cox regression model to examine the association between periodontal disease and cancer risk. In addition, we stratified the model with the propensity score by low and high SES. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Compared with our previous study, the associations for severe periodontitis and cancer incidence remained comparable after weighting by the propensity score (e.g., for total cancer: before weighting, hazard ratio = 1.24, 95% confidence interval = 1.07–1.42 vs. after weighting, hazard ratio = 1.23, 95% confidence interval = 1.05–1.44 when comparing severe periodontitis to no or mild periodontitis). Associations were comparable in low and high SES strata and statistically significant among participants with high SES. Conclusions: Complex sources of confounding by SES and its correlates are unlikely to fully account for the positive associations observed for periodontal disease and edentulism and cancer risk. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cancer; Confounding; Edentulism; Gum disease; Periodontal disease; SES","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Incidence; Jaw, Edentulous; Male; Middle Aged; Mouth, Edentulous; Neoplasms; Obesity; Periodontal Diseases; Periodontitis; Propensity Score; Proportional Hazards Models; Residence Characteristics; Risk Factors; Smoking; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Article; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer risk; childhood; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; dental health; disease association; disease classification; disease severity; female; human; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; obesity; periodontal disease; periodontitis; priority journal; propensity score; prospective study; risk factor; smoking; social status; adult; aged; demography; edentulousness; incidence; middle aged; mouth disease; neoplasm; periodontal disease; periodontitis; proportional hazards model; risk factor; social class; socioeconomics; very elderly","","","","","Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities; Maryland Cancer Registry; Maryland Cigarette Restitution Fund; NCI Cancer Center Support; National Program of Cancer Registries; National Institutes of Health, NIH; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, (HHSN268201700001I, HHSN268201700002I, HHSN268201700003I, HHSN268201700004I, HHSN268201700005I); Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI; National Cancer Institute, NCI, (R01 CA207110); National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR, (P30 CA006973, R01-DE021986, R01DE021418); Maryland State Arts Council, MSAC; Department of Health, Australian Government","Funding text 1: Cancer incidence data have been provided by the Maryland Cancer Registry, Center for Cancer Surveillance and Control, Maryland Department of Health, 201 W.

This study aimed to determine the association or otherwise between periodontitis and survival outcomes in individuals with respect to H. pylori infection. Materials and Methods: The study population comprised 4955 subjects aged 20–90 who had received both periodontal examination and H. pylori serum test in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) database. Logistic regression models were used to analyse the association between periodontitis and H. pylori seropositivity (H. pylori infection). Survival analysis was performed using the NHANES III linked to mortality data. Cox proportional hazard regression was carried out to investigate the association between periodontitis and gastrointestinal tract cancer mortality in individuals with/without H. pylori infection. Results: Compared to periodontal health, periodontitis was significantly associated with increased odds of H. pylori infection (OR = 1.271, 95% CI = 1.177–1.372). Periodontitis significantly increased the mortality risk from all causes (HR = 1.574, 95% CI = 1.327–1.866) and all cancers (HR = 1.948, 95% CI = 1.701–2.232), including gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancer (HR = 4.140, 95% CI = 3.656–4.687), gastric cancer (HR = 4.288, 95% CI = 3.969–4.632), and colorectal cancer (HR = 4.814, 95% CI = 3.849–6.020) in subjects with H. pylori infection after adjusting for health-related factors. Periodontitis was significantly related to the decreased survival time in subjects with GI tract (p =.001) or colorectal cancer (p =.002) and H. pylori infection. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that periodontitis was significantly associated with higher mortality risk of GI tract, gastric, and colorectal cancer in subjects with H. pylori infection. Owing to an interactive effect between periodontitis and H. pylori infection on cancer mortality, H. pylori infection has a significant moderating effect in regulating the association between periodontitis and mortality due to all cancers, including GI tract cancer and colorectal cancer. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Accumulating evidence suggests periodontal pathogens are involved in colorectal carcinogenesis, indicating the need for high-quality epidemiological evidence linking periodontal disease (PD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Thus, we conducted the first population-based case–control study that was specifically designed to investigate the association between compromised oral health and sporadic CRC. A total of 348 incident cases of colon or rectal cancer, and 310 age and sex frequency-matched controls, from the Montreal island and Laval population participated in the study. Data were collected on PD and on several CRC risk factors using validated questionnaires. A life-course approach was used to document long-term history regarding lifestyle factors. Multivariable unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the rate ratio (RR) quantifying the association between CRC and PD. Results showed that the rate of new diagnosis of CRC in persons with a positive history of PD was 1.45 times higher than in those with a negative history of PD adjusting for age, sex, BMI, education, income, diabetes, family history of CRC, regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, lifetime cumulative smoking, lifetime consumption of red meats, processed meats, and alcoholic drinks, and lifetime total physical activity score (adjusted RR = 1.45; 95% CI 1.04–2.01; p = 0.026). Our results support the hypothesis of an association between PD and sporadic CRC risk. © 2021, The Author(s).","Colorectal cancer; Gingivitis; Periodontal disease; Periodontitis","acetylsalicylic acid; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; adult; Article; awareness; cancer diagnosis; cancer risk; case control study; colorectal cancer; controlled study; disease association; drug use; educational status; female; gingivitis; human; logistic regression analysis; lowest income group; major clinical study; male; meat consumption; medical history; metabolic equivalent; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; osteolysis; periodontal disease; periodontitis; population research; prevalence; processed meat; Quebec; risk factor; sex difference; smoking; sporadic disease","","acetylsalicylic acid, 493-53-8, 50-78-2, 53663-74-4, 53664-49-6, 63781-77-1","","","Montreal General Hospital, Jewish General Hospital; Cancer Research Society, CRS; Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé, FRQS","Funding text 1: This project was supported by an operating grant from the Cancer Research Society.

The objective of the current study was to investigate any potential associations between parameters of periodontal disease, the number of teeth lost, and the risk of developing squamous cell esophageal cancer in a representative adult sample. Materials and Methods: The study sample included 178 healthy individuals with matched age and socioeconomic status as controls and 60 patients with the primary histological type of esophageal cancer, Squamous Cell Esophageal Cancer. Data were collected from cases and controls on epidemiological factors like age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, socio-economic status, level of education, and prior medical/dental history. The clinical data on periodontal health status was obtained through a clinical examination. This data concerned Probing Pocket Depth (PPD), Clinical Attachment Loss (CAL), the number of teeth lost, and the common risk factors for Squamous Cell Esophageal Carcinoma. Additionally, univariate, and logistic regression models that were modified for potential confounders were used to estimate unadjacent and adjacent odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Lower socioeconomic status (p = 0.048) (OR = 1.882, 95% CI = 0.987–3.591), smoking (p = 0.052) (OR = 1.768, 95% CI = 0.931–3.359), moderate and heavy alcohol abuse (p = 0.035) (OR = 1.880, 95% CI = 0.987 3.579), and irregular tooth brushing frequency (p = 0.001) (OR = 0.326, 95% CI = 0.171–0.619) were indeed discovered to be significantly linked. Conclusion: Individuals with lower socio-economic status, smoking, moderate and heavy alcohol consumption, and irregular tooth brushing frequency were significantly associated with Periodontal diseases and Squamous Cell Esophageal Cancer. © 2023 The Authors","Adults; Periodontal disease; Risk factors; Squamous Cell Esophageal Cancer","adult; aged; alcohol abuse; alcohol consumption; Article; cancer patient; clinical attachment level; clinical examination; clinical study; confounding variable; controlled study; educational status; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; female; health status; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; medical history; middle aged; people by smoking status; periodontal disease; periodontal pocket depth; retrospective study; risk factor; smoking; social status; tooth brushing","","","","","Deanship of Graduate Studies and Scientific Research at Dar Al Uloom University","The author was thankful to the Deanship of Graduate Studies and Scientific Research at Dar Al Uloom University for the financial Support for this project and to Dr. Tshetiz Dahal, Clinical Researcher, Lugansk State Medical University, Luhansk Oblast, 93000 Luhansk, Ukraine, for assisting data collections.

However, clinical data on the association between chronic gingivitis and cancer have been less conclusive. Here, we systematically evaluated the cancer incidence in a population-based cohort of outpatients with chronic gingivitis from the United Kingdom. Methods: 9891 patients with chronic gingivitis and an identical number of people without gingivitis matched by age, gender, index year, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index were identified from the Disease Analyzer database (IQVIA) between January 2000 and December 2016. Cox regression models were used to study the association between gingivitis and cancer. Results: The probability of cancer was significantly higher among patients with diagnosed chronic gingivitis compared to non-gingivitis individuals (HR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.15–1.62). In cancer site-stratified analyses, we observed a trend towards higher rates of cancer in almost all cancers (breast cancer, lymphoid system cancer, digestive tract cancers, skin cancer); however, a significant association was only observed for prostate cancer (HR: 3.38; 95% CI: 1.57–7.27). Notably, the largest increase in cancer rates was observed in male patients (HR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.13–1.89) between 41 and 60 years old (HR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.30–2.32). Conclusions: Our data suggest that chronic gingivitis represents an important risk factor for the development of cancer. Therefore, in the context of patient dental care, awareness should be raised to refer gingivitis patients to existing screening programs, especially for prostate cancer. Moreover, the consistent treatment of gingivitis could potentially have a positive impact on the morbidity of certain cancers. © 2023 by the authors.","age; biomarker; cancer; gingivitis; prostate cancer","adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer incidence; cancer risk; Charlson Comorbidity Index; cohort analysis; controlled study; dental procedure; digestive system cancer; disease association; female; gingivitis; human; ICD-10; lymphatic system malignancy; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; middle aged; patient care; practice guideline; probability; prostate cancer; retrospective study; sample size; skin cancer; United Kingdom; young adult","","","","","","","Michaud D.S., Fu Z., Shi J., Chung M., Periodontal Disease, Tooth Loss, and Cancer Risk, Epidemiol.

Materials and methods: This population-based cross-sectional study was conducted through the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database, Taiwan. Patients with malignancies were collected and subdivided into groups according to their different cancer locations, the severity of periodontitis, and dental care. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the associations between ONJ and ONJ-related factors. Results: A total of 8,234 ONJ patients and 32,912 control patients were investigated. Lip, oral cavity, and pharynx malignancies had the highest ONJ risk among all cancer locations (OR from 3.07 to 9.56, P < 0.01). There is a linear relationship between different severities of periodontitis and ONJ. Patients with radiotherapy and severe periodontitis had the highest ONJ risk (adjusted OR, 9.56; 95% CI, 5.34–17.1). Patients with good dental care had a lower ONJ risk. Conclusions: The periodontal condition and cancer location showed a significant impact on the risk of developing ONJ after adjusting for bisphosphonate use. Good dental care could decrease the risk of ONJ in cancer patients. The severity of periodontitis might be a target to predict the potency of ONJ. Clinical relevance: Dentists must be vigilant about the increased risk of ONJ in cancer patients with periodontitis, especially in the head and neck cancer population. Good dental care is advised for cancer patients with severe periodontitis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cancer location; Dental care; ONJ; Osteonecrosis of the jaw; Periodontitis; Population-based","Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diphosphonates; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Osteonecrosis; Periodontitis; Risk Factors; bisphosphonic acid derivative; bone density conservation agent; bone necrosis; complication; cross-sectional study; head and neck tumor; human; jaw osteonecrosis; periodontitis; risk factor","","Bone Density Conservation Agents, ; Diphosphonates, ","","","MOST Clinical Trial Consortium for Stroke, (109–2321-B-039–002); Tseng-Lien Lin Foundation, Taichung, Taiwan, (MOHW-M07B4079, Poh-Ai-10703); Clinical Trial Center, China Medical University Hospital, CTC, CMUH, CTC; Ministry of Health and Welfare, MOHW, (MOHW109-TDU-B-212–114004); Health Promotion Administration, Ministry of Health and Welfare, HPA; Tao Yuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare; Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, TMU-SHH; China Medical University Hospital, CMUH, (DMR-109–126); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (110-2314-B-182A-040); Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, (CMRPG3L0051); Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, FEMH, (FEMH-2021-C-051); Institute for Information Industry, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, III, (MOST 109-2321-B-039-002)","This study was supported in part by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan (MOHW109-TDU-B-212–114004), Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST 110-2314-B-182A-040), MOST Clinical Trial Consortium for Stroke (MOST 109–2321-B-039–002), China Medical University Hospital (DMR-109–126), Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, Taiwan (CMRPG3L0051), Far Eastern Memorial Hospital (FEMH-2021-C-051), and Tseng-Lien Lin Foundation, Taichung, Taiwan (MOHW-M07B4079, Poh-Ai-10703).

The present work summarizes the main differential impact each risk factor for oral cancer and periodontitis has according to biological sex- and gender-oriented differences. It resulted in differences in epidemiology and the weight of various healthy determinants that may influence the incidence and prognosis of oral cancer and periodontitis. It is desirable to change the methodology of scientific studies with a higher focus on the weight that sexual variables may have on the well-being or the probability of getting ill of each person, thus promoting the development and diffusion of personalized gender dentistry. © 2022 by the authors.","alcohol; dysbiosis; epidemiology; gender; gender medicine; hormones; oral cancer; oral microbiome; oral microbiota; periodontitis; risk assessment; sex; smoking; tobacco","","","","","","","","Gender and Health; Heidari S., Babor T.F., De Castro P., Tort S., Curno M., Sex and Gender Equity in Research: Rationale for the SAGER guidelines and recommended use, Res.

Materials and methods: Patients with a diagnosis of tonsillar cancer and availability of a digital panoramic radiograph (DPR) during a 5-year period were included in this retrospective study. The predictor variables were periodontal stability, marginal bone loss, marginal bone loss without periodontal stability and total number of teeth. Periodontal status was compared with p16 status, age, gender, smoking and alcohol use. Results: Among 115 patients included in the analyses (p16-negative, n = 24; p16-positive, n = 91), smoking (p <.0001), heavy alcohol use (p <.0001) and total number of teeth (p =.0001) were significantly associated with p16 status. Current smoking (OR = 7.3) and heavy alcohol use (OR = 10.1) increased the risk of p16-negative cancer. Conclusions: Patients with p16-negative tonsillar carcinoma had less teeth than patients with p16-positive tumours. Other periodontal findings were common in both groups without statistical significance. Heavy alcohol use and smoking were the most important risk factors for p16-negative tonsillar carcinoma. © The Authors.

Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium that acts as a periodontal pathogen, being an important factor in linking Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in the periodontal biofilm, but its involvement in systemic diseases has also been found. Several studies regarding the implication of Fusobacterium nucleatum in gastro-enterological cancers have been conducted. The present review aims to update and systematize the latest information about Fusobacterium nucleatum in order to evaluate the possibility of an association between periodontal disease and the evolution of gastroenterological cancers through the action of Fusobacterium nucleatum, highlighting gastric cancer. This would motivate future research on the negative influence of periodontal pathology on the evolution of gastric cancer in patients suffering from both pathologies. © 2020 by the authors.

Therefore, we did a meta-analysis to ascertain the correlation of PD with the risk of incident lung cancer. Methods: The authors searched relevant studies in databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and MEDLINE) till November 2020. We registered the study at the International database of Prospectively Registered Systemic Reviews under the CRD42020198119. The summary relative risk (RR) along with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using fixed-effects models. Results: Twelve studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. The pooled analysis revealed that PD was significantly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (RR 1.71; 95%CI 1.61-1.81; P < 0.01). Subgroup analysis was performed based on gender distribution, geographic location, and type of studies. Conclusion: From this current evidence, PD is a potential risk factor for the development of lung cancer. The risk for incidence of lung cancer is surged twice in the patients with PD, even though age and smoking are controlled in the studies. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

We searched Medline/PubMed database. English language publications were included in the study. Paired reviewers selected articles for inclusion and extracted data. Forty-four studies met our inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies were review (63.8%) and clinical studies (36.2%). There is a lack of studies regarding the association of periodontal disease (PD) and OM. However, there are pathogenic similarities between them. Look for scientific evidence to confirm the relationship between PD and OM is imperative. Thus, if periodontitis can actually interfere with the occurrence and severity of OM, the establishment of strategies to reduce it may contribute to better control of OM, a serious adverse effect of cancer treatment. © 2019 European Journal of General Dentistry | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Cancer therapy;

This review focused on the oral microbiota alterations in population suffering from lung cancer. In addition, we also discussed conflicting data about the association between oral microbiota dysbiosis and risk of lung cancer. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in Medline, Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases. The studies evaluated diversity and abundance of oral microbes in healthy and lung cancer individuals as well as association of periodontal disease and pathogens with lung cancer. Of 3559 studies, 28 included studies were performed in qualitative analysis, and 25 studies were used in meta-analyses for quantitative assessment. Heterogeneity was analyzed by using I² and chi-squared Q test statistics. Statistical analyses were performed by using the RevMan 5.4 software. Results: Compared with the control, lung cancer patients had lower alpha diversity (Shannon: SMD = -0.54; 95% CI, -0.90 to -0.19; P < .01, I2 = 71%). In nested case-control studies, individuals with decreased alpha diversity tended to have an increased risk of lung cancer (observed species: HR = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85-0.96; P < .01, I2 = 0%; Shannon: HR = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83-0.95; P < .01, I2 = 0%). Overall, no strong evidence of association of relative abundance with specific oral microbes with lung cancers was found because of inconsistent data. No associations were found between periodontal pathogens and lung cancer risk (red complex: HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.42-3.02, P = .82, I2 = 62%; orange complex: HR =1.77, 95% CI: 0.78-3.98, P = .17, I2 = 36%), expect for Fusobacterium nucleatum (HR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.13-4.58, P = .02, I2 = 0%). The positive association of periodontal disease with lung cancer risk was found (HR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.25-2.00, P < .001, I2= 0%) with increase of periodontal diseases severity (HR = 2.39, 95% CI: 1.57-3.66, P < .001, I2 = 0%). However, such association was not found in never-smoker participants (HR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.76-1.31, P = .37, I2= 7%). Conclusions: Lower alpha diversity of oral microbiome may be associated with a greater risk of lung cancer and might serve as a predictive signal of lung cancer risk. There was no strong evidence of relative abundance of oral microbial taxa and periodontal pathogens in lung cancer patients. Fusobacterium nucleatum might be a potential microbial candidate of biomarkers in lung cancer. Periodontal disease may be positively associated with lung cancer risk by confounding of smoking, but not an independent risk factor. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","","Case-Control Studies; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Microbiota; Periodontal Diseases; Research Design; case control study; human; lung tumor; meta analysis; methodology; microflora; periodontal disease","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81970982)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [ 81970982 ].

Information sources in the grey literature were not cited. Study selection Cohort studies and case-control studies in English were selected by two reviewers independently. All articles had to include a control patient group (without periodontal disease) and a group with periodontal disease and both groups with prostate cancer outcomes. Also, all articles reported the hazard ratio (HR), relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) estimates with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Data extraction and synthesis Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were performed by two reviewers independently and any disagreements between these authors were resolved through discussion or by consulting a third author. Data were synthesised qualitatively by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RR with 95% CI was used as the pooled estimate to assess the association of periodontal disease and the risk of prostate cancer. When the outcome of interest was rare, it was considered that the OR approximated the RR (24). HR was also treated as RR when pooled in this meta-analysis. The heterogeneity across studies was evaluated by Q test (statistical significance was considered when P <0.1) and the I2 statistic (I2 ≥50% indicated significant heterogeneity). Results Seven studies were included in the meta-analyses, with four being prospective cohort studies and three retrospective cohort studies. All studies were of high quality except one study that was considered to be of moderate quality. Pooled estimates indicated that periodontal disease had a significant statistical relationship with the risk of prostate cancer (RR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.07-1.27; P = 0.001). No significant heterogeneity across studies was observed (P = 0.383; I2 = 5.8%). The studies include Asian, European and American populations. Conclusions The authors of this review concluded that periodontal disease could be a possible risk for prostate cancer and that the male public, and clinicians, should be aware of the importance of maintaining good periodontal health. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the British Dental Association.","","Cohort Studies; Humans; Male; Periodontal Diseases; Prospective Studies; Prostatic Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; cohort analysis; complication; human; male; periodontal disease; prospective study; prostate tumor; retrospective study","","","","","","","Wei Y., Zhong Y., Wang Y., Huang R., Association between periodontal disease and prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal, (2021); Caton J.G., Armitage G., Berglundh T., Et al., A new classification scheme for periodontal and peri-implant diseases and conditions - Introduction and key changes from the 1999 classification, J Periodontol, 89, pp. S1-S8, (2018); Perdana N.R., Mochtar C.A., Umbas R., Hamid A.R., The Risk Factors of Prostate Cancer and Its Prevention: A Literature Review, Acta Med Indones, 48, pp. 228-238, (2016); Stewart L., Moher D., Shekelle P., Why prospective registration of systematic reviews makes sense, Syst Rev, 1, (2012); Walpole S.C., Including papers in languages other than English in systematic reviews: important, feasible, yet often omitted, J Clin Epidemiol, 111, pp. 127-134, (2019); Page M.J., McKenzie J.E., Bossuyt P.M., Et al., The PRISMA 2020 statement: An updated guideline for reporting systematic reviews, Int J Surg, 88, (2021); Liberati A., Altman D.G., Tetzlaff J., Et al., The PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that evaluate healthcare interventions: explanation and elaboration, BMJ, (2009); Hartling L., Milne A., Hamm M.P., Et al., Testing the Newcastle Ottawa Scale showed low reliability between individual reviewers, J Clin Epidemiol, 66, pp. 982-993, (2013); Zhang Y., Akl E.A., Schunemann H.J., Using systematic reviews in guideline development: the GRADE approach, Res Synth Methods, (2018); Guyatt G., Oxman A.D., Akl E.A., Et al., GRADE guidelines: 1.

Adults (≥18 years) with mild and severe CP were identified from a random sample of 2 million insured patients in the National Health Insurance Research Database (2001-2010). After propensity score matching, 25,485 individuals, each with mild or severe CP, were included for comparison. The primary endpoint was the incidence of total or individual GI cancers, including cancers of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon/rectum, and pancreas. Cox proportional hazard models with the robust aggregated sandwich estimator were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) after adjusting for known risk factors. GI cancers occurred in 275 individuals with mild CP and 324 individuals with severe CP. After adjusting for known risk factors, severe CP was not associated with an increased risk of total GI cancer relative to mild CP (HR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.84-1.16) or individual GI cancers, including esophageal (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.62-2.15), gastric (HR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.68-1.49), small intestinal (HR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.22-2.22), colorectal (HR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.78-1.16), and pancreatic cancers (HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.47-1.75). Severe CP was not associated with an increased risk of total or individual GI cancers when compared with mild CP. © 2018 the Author(s).

This meta-analysis aimed to assess the relationship between periodontitis and the aforementioned five cancers. Methods: Eligible studies on the association between periodontitis and the aforementioned five kinds of cancers were retrieved. The statistical analysis was conducted using Stata 12.0. Results: Ten articles (more than 100,000 samples for most cancers) were included. With statistical significance, participants with periodontitis might have enhanced risks of esophageal cancer (HR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.15–2.79), prostate cancer (HR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.09-1.31), hematological malignancy (HR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.09–1.29), and melanoma of skin (HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.03–1.42), compared with those without periodontitis. However, the evidence regarding the correlation between periodontitis and the susceptibility to kidney cancer was lacking (HR=1.30, 95% CI: 0.96-1.76). Conclusions: The present meta-analysis revealed a potential link between periodontitis and esophageal cancer, prostate cancer, hematological malignancy, and melanoma of the skin. However, multi-center studies with large sample sizes and multivariable adjustments are still needed to support the conclusion. © The author(s).","Esophageal cancer; Hematological malignancy; Melanoma of the skin; Meta-analysis; Periodontitis; Prostate cancer","Case-Control Studies; Esophageal Neoplasms; Hematologic Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Melanoma; Periodontitis; Prostatic Neoplasms; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Skin Neoplasms; age distribution; Article; cancer risk; cancer susceptibility; dental prophylaxis; dietary intake; disease association; drinking behavior; esophagus cancer; hematologic malignancy; human; kidney cancer; melanoma; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; periodontitis; prostate cancer; risk assessment; risk factor; sex difference; smoking habit; social status; case control study; complication; esophagus tumor; hematologic disease; male; melanoma; meta analysis; periodontitis; prostate tumor; skin tumor","","","","","Guangdong basic and applied basic research Foundation; Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province, (2019A1515011289); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81400505, 81700950); Sun Yat-sen University, SYSU, (17ykpy74); National College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program, (20201087)","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81700950, 81400505), Guangdong basic and applied basic research Foundation (No. 2019A1515011289), the Youth Teacher Training Project of Sun Yat-Sen University (No. 17ykpy74), and National College Student's Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program (No. 20201087).

Regarding the connection between breast cancer treatments and periodontal disease, the level of Interleukin-29 may be considered as a tool for prognostic prediction of disease to take adequate measures to prevent it. This study was conducted to assess the level of Interleukin-29 among women with breast cancer and periodontitis, and the quantity of HSV-1 antigen was also assessed. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 90 women with breast cancer divided into three groups: periodontal patients after receiving chemotherapy (n=30), periodontal patients not receiving chemotherapy treatment (n=30), and patients without periodontitis as a control group (n=30). The levels of Interleukin-29 and HSV-1 antigen were measured using saliva samples of individuals and the ELISA method. The mean level of Interleukin-29 and HSV-1 antigen was analyzed among the three groups using the ANOVA test. Results: The mean of HSV-1 antigen in the group of patients with periodontitis after receiving chemotherapy was higher than the other two groups, but no statistically significant difference was observed among the three groups (P=0.071). The mean of Interleukin-29 level in the periodontitis group receiving chemotherapy (296.85) showed no significant differences as compared to the periodontitis group not receiving chemotherapy (314.99) and the control group (303.79) (P=0.572). Conclusion: Compared to patients without periodontitis, the mean of Interleukin-29 level was greater in breast cancer patients with periodontitis. Moreover, a high level of HSV-1 antigen in periodontal patients receiving chemotherapy revealed an increased risk of periodontitis in breast cancer patients, emphasizing the importance of paying attention to oral and dental health in breast cancer patients.

Higher prevalence of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease (CKD), obesity, osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative diseases has been reported among patients with diabetes. Metformin is the oldest oral antidiabetic drug and can improve coexisting complications of diabetes. Clinical trials and observational studies uncovered that metformin can remarkably prevent or alleviate cardiovascular diseases, obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), osteoporosis, cancer, periodontitis, neuronal damage and neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), tuberculosis, and COVID-19. In addition, metformin has been proposed as an antiaging agent. Numerous mechanisms were shown to be involved in the protective effects of metformin. Metformin activates the LKB1/AMPK pathway to interact with several intracellular signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms. The drug modifies the biologic function of NF-κB, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, SIRT1/PGC-1α, NLRP3, ERK, P38 MAPK, Wnt/β-catenin, Nrf2, JNK, and other major molecules in the intracellular signaling network. It also regulates the expression of noncoding RNAs. Thereby, metformin can regulate metabolism, growth, proliferation, inflammation, tumorigenesis, and senescence. Additionally, metformin modulates immune response, autophagy, mitophagy, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and apoptosis and exerts epigenetic effects. Furthermore, metformin protects against oxidative stress and genomic instability, preserves telomere length, and prevents stem cell exhaustion. In this review, the protective effects of metformin on each disease will be discussed using the results of recent meta-analyses, clinical trials, and observational studies. Thereafter, it will be meticulously explained how metformin reprograms intracellular signaling pathways and alters molecular and cellular interactions to modify the clinical presentations of several diseases.  © ","Cancer; Cardiovascular diseases; Metformin; Neurodegenerative diseases; Osteoporosis; Senescence","metformin; cell interaction; chronic kidney failure; chronic liver disease; clinical feature; cognitive defect; colitis; congestive heart failure; degenerative disease; drug effect; heart protection; human; hyperglycemia; immune system; inflammation; inflammatory bowel disease; intracellular signaling; malignant neoplasm; molecular interaction; nerve degeneration; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; osteoporosis; ovary polycystic disease; periodontitis; renal protection; Review; senescence","","metformin, 1115-70-4, 657-24-9","","","","","Khan M.A.B., Hashim M.J., King J.K., Govender R.D., Mustafa H., Al Kaabi J., Epidemiology of type 2 diabetes-global burden of disease and forecasted trends, Journal of Epidemiology and Global Health, 10, (2020); Bhutani J., Bhutani S., Worldwide burden of diabetes, Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism, 18, (2014); Lozano R., Naghavi M., Foreman K., Lim S., Shibuya K., Aboyans V., Abraham J., Adair T., Aggarwal R., Ahn S.Y., Et al., Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, Lancet, 380, pp. 2095-2128, (2012); Mantovani A., Turino T., Lando M.G., Gjini K., Byrne C.D., Zusi C., Ravaioli F., Colecchia A., Maffeis C., Salvagno G., Et al., Screening for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease using liver stiffness measurement and its association with chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes, Diabetes Metab., 46, pp. 296-303, (2020); Lee H.W., Wong G.L.H., Kwok R., Choi K.C., Chan C.K.M., Shu S.S.T., Leung J.K.Y., Chim A.M.L., Luk A.O.Y., Ma R.C.W., Et al., Serial transient elastography examinations to monitor patients with type 2 diabetes: A prospective cohort study, Hepatology, 72, (2020); Fowler M.J., Microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes, Clinical Diabetes, 26, pp. 77-82, (2008); Corriere M., Rooparinesingh N., Kalyani R.R., Epidemiology of diabetes and diabetes complications in the elderly: An emerging public health burden, Curr.

We evaluated the association of clinically assessed periodontal disease and a consequence, edentulism with total cancer mortality in participants without a prior cancer diagnosis in a U.S. nationally representative population. Included were 6,034 participants aged ≥40 years without a prior cancer diagnosis who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III. Periodontal health was measured by trained dentists. Cancer deaths (n = 702) were ascertained during a median of 21.3 years of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the association of periodontal disease and edentulism with total cancer mortality using no periodontal disease/dentate as the reference and adjusting for potential demographic, lifestyle including smoking and social factor confounders. Fifteen percent had periodontitis and 17% were edentulous. Periodontitis was not statistically significantly associated with risk of total cancer death after multivariable adjustment. Edentulism was associated with an increased risk of cancer mortality (hazard ratio = 1.50, 95% confidence interval = 1.12–2.00) after multivariable adjustment, including in men and women and in each racial/ethnic group studied. The positive association was observed in overweight/obese participants but not participants with normal body mass index, more strongly in prediabetic/diabetic participants than in participants without diabetes and in ever cigarette smokers but not in never cigarette smokers. In this U.S. nationally representative population, those with edentulism, but not periodontal disease, had a higher risk of total cancer death, especially in those with shared risk factors for periodontal disease and cancer. © 2020 UICC","cancer; edentulism; mortality; periodontal disease","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Datasets as Topic; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Mouth, Edentulous; Neoplasms; Nutrition Surveys; Periodontal Diseases; Prognosis; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; United States; Young Adult; adult; aged; Article; body mass; cancer diagnosis; cancer mortality; cigarette smoking; cross-sectional study; ethnicity; female; follow up; human; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality risk; obesity; periodontal disease; periodontitis; prevalence; priority journal; race; risk factor; United States; adolescent; information processing; Kaplan Meier method; mortality; mouth disease; neoplasm; nutrition; periodontal disease; prognosis; risk assessment; young adult","","","","","AACR-Johnson & Johnson Lung Cancer Innovation Science; AACR‐Johnson & Johnson Lung Cancer Innovation Science, (18‐90‐52‐MICH); Maryland Cigarette Restitution Fund at Johns Hopkins; National Cancer Institute, NCI, (P30CA006973)","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the National Cancer Institute (P30CA006973, Nelson), the Maryland Cigarette Restitution Fund at Johns Hopkins and the 2018 AACR-Johnson & Johnson Lung Cancer Innovation Science Grant Number 18-90-52-MICH.; Funding text 2: This work was supported in part by the National Cancer Institute (P30CA006973, Nelson), the Maryland Cigarette Restitution Fund at Johns Hopkins and the 2018 AACR‐Johnson & Johnson Lung Cancer Innovation Science Grant Number 18‐90‐52‐MICH.

Epidemiological investigations show that smoking, periodontal disease and oral cancer are closely related. Tobacco is one of the major risk factors for periodontitis and oral cancer. METHODS A systematic literature review was performed. To identify relevant studies, the following online databases were searched using specific keywords: PubMed, Web of Science and CNKI. RESULTS Tobacco not only possesses an addictive effect, but it aggravates periodontal disease by promoting the invasion of pathogenic bacteria, inhibiting autoimmune defense, aggravating the inflammatory reaction, and aggravating the loss of alveolar bone. According to current evidence, tobacco significantly aggravates the development and progression of periodontal disease and oral cancer, and periodontal disease may be related to the prevalence of oral cancer. CONCLUSIONS Clinicians should strongly recommend that smokers undertake a strategy to stop smoking to avoid the exacerbation of nicotine-related periodontal disease and to reduce the incidence of oral cancer. © 2019 Zhang Y.","Alveolar bone; Inflammation; Oral cancer; Periodontal disease; Tobacco","gelatinase A; matrix metalloproteinase 14; alveolar bone; autoimmunity; bacterial cell; bacterial colonization; biofilm; cancer incidence; Candida albicans; Candida parapsilosis; causal attribution; cell adhesion; cell migration; cell viability; clinical feature; disease association; disease exacerbation; fluorescence microscopy; human; immune response; inflammation; mouth cancer; mouth cavity; nonhuman; periodontal disease; periodontal ligament; Porphyromonas gingivalis; prevalence; priority journal; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; risk factor; smoking habit; Streptococcus gordonii; systematic review; tobacco consumption; tooth germ; transmission electron microscopy","","gelatinase A, 146480-35-5; matrix metalloproteinase 14, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31800114, 81400501, 81500811)","This review was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81400501 to ML, 31800114 to RH and 81500811 to BH).","Razavi S.M., Siadat S., Rahbar P., Hosseini S.M., Shirani A.M., Trends in oral cancer rates in Isfahan, Iran during 1991-2010, Dent Res J (Isfahan)., 9, pp. S88-S93, (2012); Sutton J.D., Salas Martinez M.L., Gerkovich M.M., Environmental tobacco smoke and periodontitis in United States non-smokers, 2009 to 2012, J Periodontol., 88, 6, pp. 565-574, (2017); Akinkugbe A.A., Sanders A.E., Preisser J.S., Cai J., Salazar C.R., Beck J.D., Environmental tobacco smoke exposure and periodontitis prevalence among nonsmokers in the hispanic community Health Study/Study of Latinos, Community Dentistry and Oral Epidemiology., 45, 2, pp. 168-177, (2017); Akinkugbe A.A., Slade G.D., Divaris K., Poole C., Systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and periodontitis endpoints among nonsmokers, Nicotine & Tobacco Research: Official Journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco., 18, 11, pp. 2047-2056, (2016); Dietrich T., Walter C., Oluwagbemigun K., Et al., Smoking, smoking cessation, and risk of tooth loss: The epicpotsdam study, J Dent Res., 94, 10, pp. 1369-1375, (2015); Ozden F.O., Ozgonenel O., Ozden B., Aydogdu A., Diagnosis of periodontaldiseases using different classification algorithms: A preliminary study, Niger J Clin Pract., 18, 3, pp. 416-421, (2015); Pihlstrom B.L., Michalowicz B.S., Johnson N.W., Periodontal diseases, Lancet., 366, 9499, pp. 1809-1820, (2005); Genco R.B., Borgnakke W.S., Risk factors for periodontal disease, Periodontology 2000., 62, 1, pp. 59-94, (2013); Pindborg J.J., Tobacco and gingivitis: I.

Accordingly, this meta-analysis was conducted. Methods: Relevant studies published until April 2018 were retrieved and were screened according to established inclusion criteria. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the association between periodontal disease and the risk of breast cancer and fixed effect models were used according to the results of the heterogeneity test. Results: Eight studies, involving 168,111 individuals, were identified as having explored the association between periodontal disease and breast cancer. Summary estimates in view of adjusted data showed that periodontal disease did increase susceptibility to breast cancer (RR = 1.18, 95%CI: 1.11–1.26, I2 = 17.6%), with robust results confirmed by sensitivity analysis. Conclusion: Our results provided evidence of a modest positive association between periodontal disease and breast cancer. Implementation of practical measures to prevent and treat periodontal disease is of great public health significance. Moreover, additional studies are recommended to explore this topic in more detail. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The rapid evolution of technology for these products generated a wide variety of models, and electronic cigarettes have quickly gained worldwide popularity. However, research regarding the effects of both short-term and long-term exposure revealed a wide variety of potential negative effects on human health, and the first system to be affected by these electronic smoking devices is the oral cavity. This review makes an up-to-date extensive presentation of the possible mechanisms that associate electronic cigarette smoking with increased prevalence and progression of oral cancer. Oxidative stress, inflammation response, and DNA damage are the main mechanisms that explain e-cigarettes’ cytotoxicity, but there are still questions to be answered. At present, tens of thousands of e-liquids are available, with distinct compositions, which makes the research even more challenging. Another aspect approached in the present paper is the effect of nicotine on chemotherapy drug resistance. Nicotine activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, consecutively inhibiting apoptosis, increasing tumor cells proliferation and survival, and reducing the effects of chemotherapy drugs. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the causal link between these two phenotypes remains uncertain. This study aimed to examine the bidirectional causal association between periodontitis and four types of urological tumors, specifically kidney cancer (KC), prostate cancer (PC), bladder cancer (BC), and testis cancer (TC). Methods: Based on large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, we utilized the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to evaluate causal relationships between periodontitis and urological cancers. Several MR methods covering various consistency assumptions were applied in this study, including contamination mixture and Robust Adjusted Profile Score to obtain robust results. Summary-level data of individuals with European ancestry were extracted from the UK Biobank, the Kaiser GERA cohorts, and the FinnGen consortium. Results: Our findings revealed significant positive genetic correlations between periodontitis and kidney cancer (OR 1.287; 95% CI 1.04, 1.594; P = 0.020). We did not find a significant association of periodontitis on prostate cancer, bladder cancer, and testis cancer. In reverse MR, no significant results were observed supporting the effect of urologic cancers on periodontitis (all P > 0.05). Conclusion: Our study provides the evidence of a potential causal relationship between periodontitis and kidney cancer. However, large-scale studies are warranted to confirm and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this association. © 2023, The Author(s).","Causal relationship; Genetic epidemiology; Immunity; Mendelian randomization; Periodontitis; Urologic neoplasms","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (32101206, 32171285); Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province, SPDST, (2023YFS0025, 2023YFS0102); Sichuan University, SCU, (2023HXFH044); West China Hospital, Sichuan University, WCH","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 32171285 and 32101206), the Key Program of Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province (Grant Nos. 2023YFS0025 and 2023YFS0102), and 1·3·5 project for disciplines of excellence–Clinical Research Fund, West China Hospital, Sichuan University (Grant No. 2023HXFH044).

We studied with 10 years follow-up of 68,273 adults-based cohort the involvement of periodontitis as a risk factor for cancer mortality. Periodontal status was defined based on procedure codes of periodontal treatment. Rate ratios and absolute differences of overall and cancer mortality rates were assessed with respect to periodontal status using multiplicative and additive Poisson regression models, respectively. We adjusted for effect of age, sex, calendar time, socio-economic status, oral health, dental treatments and diabetes. Data about smoking or alcohol consumption were not available. Altogether 797 cancer deaths occurred during 664,020 person-years accumulated over a mean 10.1-year follow-up. Crude cancer mortality rate per 10,000 person-years for participants without and with periodontitis was 11.36 (95% CI 10.47–12.31) and 14.45 (95% CI 12.51–16.61), respectively. Crude rate ratios for periodontitis indicated an increased risk of overall (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.08–1.39) and pancreatic cancer (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.04–2.76) mortality. After adjustment, the results showed even stronger associations of periodontitis with increased overall (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.10–1.58) and pancreatic cancer (RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.31–3.98) mortality. A higher pancreatic cancer mortality among individuals with periodontitis contributed considerably to the difference in overall cancer mortality, but this difference was not due to pancreatic cancer deaths alone. © 2018 UICC","cancer; low-grade inflammation; mortality; pancreatic cancer; periodontitis","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Female; Finland; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Periodontitis; Population Surveillance; Registries; Socioeconomic Factors; adult; age; aged; Article; cancer mortality; cancer risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; dental procedure; dental surgery; diabetes mellitus; disease association; disease registry; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mouth hygiene; periodontitis; priority journal; publication; risk factor; sex; social status; time factor; complication; Finland; follow up; health survey; mortality; neoplasm; periodontitis; register; socioeconomics; very elderly","","","","","Finnish Cancer Registry; Finnish Social Insurance Institution; Public Dental Service of the City of Helsinki","The authors gratefully acknowledge the leading dentist Merja Auero, the Public Dental Service of the City of Helsinki and the dentist Tuomo Maisala, Technical Assistant, for collecting the data from the patient register of the Public Dental Service of the City of Helsinki.

Methods: We examined the relationship between self-reported diagnosis of periodontal bone loss and incidence of breast cancer in a large, prospective cohort study, the Nurses' Health Study (1998- 2014). We calculated HRs using Cox proportional hazards modeling, adjusting for risk factors common to both periodontal disease and breast cancer. Results: During 1, 023, 647 person-years of follow-up, 5, 110 of breast cancer cases were reported. We observed no association between periodontal disease and overall breast cancer risk (HR, 1.02; 95% confidence interval: 0.94-1.10); the association was not modified by smoking status, or other breast cancer risk factors or by breast tumor subtypes. Conclusions: We did not observe any association between periodontal disease and breast cancer risk. Impact: Given inconsistent findings in the literature, further research with standardized clinical measures of periodontitis is warranted. © 2021 American Association for Cancer Research.","","Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Negative Results; Periodontal Diseases; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; acetylsalicylic acid; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; adult; alveolar bone loss; Article; breast cancer; breast disease; breast tumor; cancer hormone therapy; cancer incidence; cancer risk; cohort analysis; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; mouth examination; nurse; osteoporosis; periodontitis; prospective study; risk factor; self report; smoking; aged; breast tumor; middle aged; periodontal disease; proportional hazards model","","acetylsalicylic acid, 493-53-8, 50-78-2, 53663-74-4, 53664-49-6, 63781-77-1","","","Interdisciplinary Training in Cancer Epidemiology; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Cancer Institute, NCI, (P01CA087969, T32CA113951, UM1CA186107); Breast Cancer Research Foundation, BCRF","This work was supported by the following grants from the NCI at the NIH: UM1 CA186107 (to A.H.

However, no formal systematic review and meta-analysis have been performed. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association between PD and CRC risk in this study. Materials and Methods: We used the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science to search for related articles published from 1 January 1966 to 16 July 2020. Stata (Version 15) software was used to calculate the total risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the included studies through the random-effects model to assess the association between PD and CRC risk. Results: Nine studies were included in the narrative synthesis, and seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results showed that PD significantly increased the risk of CRC by 44% (RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.18–1.76; I2, 55.2%). Conclusion: We found an association between PD and CRC. PD can be a potential risk indicator for the occurrence and development of CRC, and further studies are needed to assess causality. Hence, effective periodontal treatment could be a valuable preventive measure for CRC. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, its association with prostate cancer remains inconclusive. Herein, we explored the association of periodontal disease with the risk of prostate cancer through a meta-analysis. Materials and Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Sciences and Cochrane Library databases were searched for eligible publications up to April 2020. Multivariate adjusted risk estimates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted and calculated using random- or fixed-effect models. Results: Nine cohort studies involving 3.353 prostate cancer cases with 440.911 participants were identified and included in the meta-analysis. We found that periodontal disease significantly increased the risk of prostate cancer by 1.40-fold (hazard ratio [HR]=1.40, 95% CI: 1.16-1.70; P=0.001; I2=76.1%) compared with normal condition. Interestingly, the risk of developing prostate cancer was not significant in patients treated with periodontal therapy (HR=1.22, 95% CI: 0.86-1.73; P=0.272; I2=65.2%). The results of subgroup analyses were also consistent and significant when stratified by study design and follow-up period, whereas conflicting results were observed in periodontal disease ascertainment stratification. These findings were robust as indicated by sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Periodontal disease was associated with the increased risk of prostate cancer, whereas no significant association was observed in patients treated with periodontal therapy. Hence, the awareness and importance for maintaining oral health should be improved, and the underlying mechanisms linking periodontal disease and prostate cancer should be fully explored in future research. © 2021.

This review aimed to summarize the relationship between periodontal disease and breast cancer, providing some strategies for the clinical treatment and peri-odontal health care of breast cancer patients. Materials and Methods: Systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, prospective and retrospective clinical studies, case series and reports were collected using search terms entered into the PubMed, Google Scholar and JSTOR databases. Results: Research has provided some evidence that periodontal disease is related to the occurrence and development of breast cancer. Periodontal disease and breast cancer have some common pathogenic factors. Periodontal disease may affect the initiation and development of breast cancer involving microorganisms and inflammation. Periodontal health is affected by radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy for breast cancer. Conclusions: Periodontal therapy for breast cancer patients should be performed differently according to the stage of cancer treatment. Adjuvant endocrine treatment (e.g. bisphosphonates) has a great impact on oral treatment. Peri-odontal therapy contributes to the primary prevention of breast cancer. Periodontal health care of breast cancer patients is worthy of clinician attention. © This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Dysbiosis of oral microbiota has already been established as a major factor contributing to periodontitis. Recent emerging epidemiological evidence and the detection of oral microbiota in genitourinary organs indicate the presence of an oral-genitourinary axis and oral microbiota may be involved in the pathogenesis of genitourinary cancers. Therefore, oral microbiota provides the bridge between periodontitis and genitourinary cancers. We have carried out this narrative review which summarizes epidemiological studies exploring the association between periodontitis and genitourinary cancers. We have also highlighted the current evidence demonstrating the capacity of oral microbiota to regulate almost all hallmarks of cancer, and proposed the potential mechanisms of oral microbiota in the development of genitourinary cancers. © 2021, The Author(s).","Kidney neoplasms; Oral microbiota; Oral-genitourinary axis; Periodontitis; Prostatic neoplasms; Urinary bladder neoplasms; Urogenital neoplasms","Dysbiosis; Humans; Microbiota; Periodontitis; Risk Factors; Urogenital Neoplasms; bladder tumor; cancer risk; disease association; dysbiosis; Fusobacterium nucleatum; human; inflammation; intracellular signaling; kidney tumor; mouth flora; nonhuman; oral urogenital axis; organ systems; Parvimonas micra; pathogenesis; periodontitis; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Prevotella intermedia; Prevotella nigrescens; prostate tumor; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; Tannerella forsythia; Treponema denticola; urogenital tract cancer; complication; microflora; periodontitis; urogenital tract tumor","","","","","Health Commission of Hubei Province Scientific Research Project, (WJ2019H035); Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University Science, Technology and Innovation Seed Fund, (znpy2019011); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, (2019FFB03902); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2042020kf0130)","This work was supported by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University Science, Technology and Innovation Seed Fund (No. znpy2019011), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2042020kf0130), the Nature Science Foundation of Hubei Province (No. 2019FFB03902), and the Health Commission of Hubei Province Scientific Research Project (No. WJ2019H035).

For this population-based nested case–control study using the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database derived from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified patients (n = 1292) who were newly diagnosed with pharyngeal cancer between 2005 and 2013 and exactly paired them with propensity score matched control subjects (n = 2584). Periodontitis and scaling and root planing (SRP) were identified before the index date. Pharyngeal cancer was subdivided into 3 subgroups on the basis of anatomic location: nasopharyngeal cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, and hypopharyngeal cancer. A multiple conditional logistic regression model was applied to analyze the adjusted odds ratio (aOR). Periodontitis was associated with an increased risk of pharyngeal cancer (aOR, 1.57; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17 to 2.10), especially oropharyngeal cancer (aOR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.07 to 4.60). We found a decreased risk of pharyngeal cancer in patients who had undergone SRP (aOR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.96). In conclusion, this study showed that periodontitis was associated with an increased risk of pharyngeal cancer and SRP exerted a protective effect against pharyngeal cancer. Our results suggest that treating periodontitis and performing SRP, which are modifiable factors in oral health, in clinical practice may provide an opportunity to decrease the disease burden of pharyngeal cancer in Taiwan. © 2020 by the authors.

Previous studies investigating the relationship between periodontal disease (PD) and CRC showed controversial conclusions. This meta-analysis is to explore the association between PD and CRC. Methods: Observational studies that explore the association between CRC and PD were included in this meta-analysis. A comprehensive literature search in 7 electronic databases to identify all relevant studies published prior to February 2020. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was used to evaluate the quality each study. The pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to estimate the association between the PD and CRC risk. Results: A total of 838 articles were obtained from database searching and 4 articles were obtained from other sources, and 13 articles with 14 studies involving 634,744 participants were included. An association between PD and increased CRC incidence was found, periodontal disease patients were 21% (95%CI, [1.06, 1.38], I2=83.9%) more likely to develop colorectal cancer than people with healthy oral cavity. But there is no significant association between PD and CRC mortality. The heterogeneity of this meta-analysis was relatively high, I2 was 83.9% (95%CI, [72.7%, 90.5%]), chi-squared of Q test was 62.18, but sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of the result. Funnel plot, Eggerʼs test and Beggʼs test found no publication bias of analysis. Conclusion: The current meta-analysis demonstrates an association between PD and CRC, indicating that early CRC screening is necessary for people with poor oral health, and oral health improvement might be beneficial for reducing CRC risk. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of periodontitis with OSCC across tumor location and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage among Koreans (N = 424). OSCC cases (n = 146) were recruited from Seoul National University Dental Hospital and matched by age, sex, and smoking to controls (n = 278) from the Yangpyeong health and periodontal cohort in Korea. OSCC was diagnosed through biopsy and radiographs, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Tumor location and TNM stage were classified after the surgery. Periodontitis was defined by alveolar bone loss with panoramic radiographs following the guidelines of the Fifth European Workshop in Periodontology. Alcohol intake, education, physical activity, obesity by body mass index, hypertension by blood pressure, diabetes by plasma glucose, and hypercholesterolemia by plasma cholesterol were considered as confounders. Information about age, sex, smoking, alcohol intake, education, and physical activity was obtained through interview; body mass index and blood pressure, through physical examination; and preoperative glucose and cholesterol, through laboratory tests. Bivariate analysis was applied with Fisher’s exact chi-square test. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were applied to evaluate the adjusted association of periodontitis with OSCC after controlling for confounders. Subgroup analyses were explored by OSCC and periodontitis. Participants with periodontitis were 3.7 times more likely to have OSCC (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.66, 95% CI = 1.46 to 9.23) than participants without periodontitis. The differences in periodontitis were not statistically significant across TNM stages of OSCC (P > 0.05) and its location (P > 0.05). The link was highlighted among males (aOR = 6.55), elders aged >60 y (aOR = 4.98), and those with more tooth loss (aOR = 9.99). Our data showed that periodontitis was independently associated with OSCC. Thus, the risk of OSCC could be modulated by reducing periodontitis. © International & American Associations for Dental Research 2019.","dental; epidemiology; head and neck cancer; oral diseases; oral squamous cell carcinoma; periodontal diseases","Aged; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Case-Control Studies; Humans; Male; Mouth Neoplasms; Periodontitis; Republic of Korea; Risk Factors; aged; case control study; human; male; mouth tumor; periodontitis; risk factor; South Korea; squamous cell carcinoma","","","","","Korean Ministry of Science and ICT, (NRF-2017M3A9B6062984); National Research Foundation; Seoul National University; Seoul National University Hospital, SNUH, (07-2017-0006)","Funding text 1: The authors appreciate the efforts of all health professionals and staff who took their time to gather information for the Yangpyeong cohort study and the Seoul National University cancer-periodontitis study.

This study aimed to determine whether the presence of chronic PD in old age increases the risk of PC using data in the large-scale elderly cohort. Materials and Methods: This nationwide population-based cohort study examined data of 121,240 South Korean individuals aged ≥ 60 years from the National Health Insurance Service-Elderly Cohort database who completed a national program between 2002 and 2015. For a maximum 10 years' observation period, patients with incident PC with chronic PD compared with those without chronic PD were retrospectively tracked, and Cox proportional hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, adjusted for potential confounding factors, including age, household income, insurance status, Charlson Comorbidity Index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebral infarction, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, prostatitis, smoking status, daily smoking, alcohol intake habits, one-time alcohol intake, and regular exercise. Results: The overall incidence of PC with chronic PD in 10 years was 3.0% (n = 2,063). In the multivariate Cox analysis with adjustment for confounding factors, chronic PD was associated with a 24% higher risk of PC (95% CI = 1.16-1.32, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Our results suggest that chronic PD is significantly and positively associated with PC. Larger and better-controlled studies are needed to strengthen this evidence of association and explain the underlying biological mechanisms. © The author(s).

Method: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify all relevant studies published prior to April 2019 according to the established inclusion criteria. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with a random-effects model. Results: We identified 10 studies with 26 estimates of the relationship between periodontitis and gastrointestinal cancer. The HR for the incidence of gastrointestinal cancer in periodontitis was 1.23 (95% CI: 1.10–1.37). Subgroup analyses showed that periodontitis was associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers in prospective cohort studies and high–quality studies, North American individuals, and individuals 18 years or older, as well as when the dental status was self-reported and when the study was adjusted for smoking. A meta-analysis of nine reports demonstrated that periodontitis was associated with increased mortality from gastrointestinal cancer (HR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.16–2.16). Additionally, periodontitis was associated with mortality from pancreatic cancer (HR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.44–3.37); thus, periodontitis may be a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis demonstrated that periodontitis may be a risk factor for gastrointestinal cancers. Additional prospective cohort studies are warranted to confirm these findings. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of periodontitis in patients with malignant digestive disease before surgery under general anesthesia. Methods: Patients with digestive malignant disease who underwent periodontal examination and orthopantomograph examination for preoperative oral health assessment were participated. The authors investigated the patients’ general characteristics and clinical oral information, including the presence of periodontitis. Results: One hundred twenty patients participated in this study. The mean and standard deviation of the number of teeth was 20.8 ± 8.2, and there was a statistically significant correlation between age and number of teeth. The periodontal pocket depth was 3.0 ± 1.0, and mobile teeth were observed in 62 patients. There was a statistically significant correlation between number of teeth and number of mobile teeth. However, there was no significant difference between the age of patients without mobile teeth and the age of patients with mobile teeth. Conclusions: This retrospective study performed in single-institution clarified the presence of periodontitis in patients with malignant digestive disease before surgery. Regardless of age, it is important to assess the oral health, including periodontitis, for safe surgery under general anesthesia. © 2021, The Author(s).","Caries; Digestive malignant disease; General anesthesia; Periodontal disease; Surgery","Humans; Japan; Neoplasms; Periodontal Diseases; Periodontal Pocket; Periodontitis; Retrospective Studies; complication; human; Japan; neoplasm; periodontal disease; periodontal pocket; periodontitis; retrospective study","","","","","University of Fukui","The authors would like to thank the staff of the Department of Dentistry and Oral Surgery of University of Fukui Hospital and the staff of the Center for Preoperative Assessment of University of Fukui Hospital for helping this study.","Ory J., Mourgues C., Raybaud E., Chabanne R., Jourdy J.C., Belard F., Et al., Cost assessment of a new oral care program in the intensive care unit to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, Clin Oral Investig, 22, pp. 1945-1951, (2018); Usubuchi M., Matsuura K., Goto T., Asada Y., Imai T., Ogawa T., Et al., Professional oral health care at general dental clinic reduces postoperative complications of head and neck free-flap reconstruction surgery, J Cancer, 10, pp. 205-210, (2019); Matsuda S., Saito T., Yoshida H., Yoshimura H., Sano K., Prevalence of tongue cleaning using a toothbrush: a questionnaire survey in Fukui Prefecture, Japan Biomed Res Int, 2019, (2019); Shin J., Kunisawa S., Fushimi K., Imanaka Y., Effects of preoperative oral management by dentists on postoperative outcomes following esophagectomy: Multilevel propensity score matching and weighting analyses using the Japanese inpatient database, Medicine (Baltimore), 98, (2019); Ishimaru M., Matsui H., Ono S., Hagiwara Y., Morita K., Yasunaga H., Preoperative oral care and effect on postoperative complications after major cancer surgery, Br J Surg, 105, pp. 1688-1696, (2018); Aoyama T., Tamagawa A., Clinical impact of perioperative oral/dental care on cancer surgery outcomes, Anticancer Res, 39, pp. 2711-2714, (2019); Komiya Y., Shimomura Y., Higurashi T., Sugi Y., Arimoto J., Umezawa S., Et al., Patients with colorectal cancer have identical strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum in their colorectal cancer and oral cavity, Gut, 68, pp. 1335-1337, (2019); Liu X.B., Gao Z.Y., Sun C.T., Wen H., Gao B., Li S.B., Et al., The potential role of P. gingivalis in gastrointestinal cancer: a mini review, Infect Agent Cancer., 14, (2019); Hegde R., Awan K.H., Effects of periodontal disease on systemic health, Dis Mon, 65, pp. 185-192, (2019); Michaud D.S., Fu Z., Shi J., Chung M., Periodontal disease, tooth loss, and cancer risk, Epidemiol Rev, 39, pp. 49-58, (2017); Miller S.C., Textbook of Periodontia, (1950); Caton J.G., Armitage G., Berglundh T., Chapple I.L.C., Jepsen S., Kornman K.S., Et al., A new classification scheme for periodontal and peri-implant diseases and conditions - Introduction and key changes from the 1999 classification, J Clin Periodontol, 45, pp. S1-S8, (2018); Gaitini L., Vaida S., Somri M., Croitoru M., Cherny N., Tooth mobility–a risk management tool, Anaesthesia, 52, pp. 393-394, (1997); Gaiser R.R., Castro A.D., The level of anesthesia resident training does not affect the risk of dental injury, Anesth Analg, 87, pp. 255-257, (1998); Gaudio R.M., Feltracco P., Barbieri S., Tiano L., Alberti M., Delantone M., Et al., Traumatic dental injuries during anaesthesia: part I: clinical evaluation, Dent Traumatol, 26, pp. 459-465, (2010); Newland M.C., Ellis S.J., Peters K.R., Simonson J.A., Durham T.M., Ullrich F.A., Et al., Dental injury associated with anesthesia: a report of 161,687 anesthetics given over 14 years, J Clin Anesth, 19, pp. 339-345, (2007); Giraudon A., de Saint M.G., Biais M., Benhamou D., Nouette-Gaulain K., Dental injury associated with anaesthesia: An 8-year database analysis of 592 claims from a major French insurance company, Anaesth Crit Care Pain Med, 37, pp. 49-53, (2018); Enomoto A., Morikage E., Shimoide T., Matsunaga K., Hamada S., Effectiveness of an interdisciplinary medical hospital admission center: the role of the dental section in the interdisciplinary system for perioperative management of patients awaiting surgery, J Med Syst, 41, (2017); Gawlak D., Manka-Malara K., Swiderska M., Kosieradzki M., Trzebicki J., Mierzwinska-Nastalska E., The assessment of the performance and usability of custom intraoral mouthguards during surgery with endotracheal intubation—a preliminary study, J Clin Anesth, 60, pp. 26-27, (2020); Papapanou P.N., Sanz M., Buduneli N., Dietrich T., Feres M., Fine D.H., Et al., Periodontitis: consensus report of workgroup 2 of the 2017 world workshop on the classification of periodontal and peri-implant diseases and conditions, J Clin Periodontol, 45, pp. S162-S170, (2018)","S.

Data in the literature suggest that people with periodontal disease have an increased risk of developing oral cancer, and the severity of periodontitis correlates with the appearance of oral squamous cell carcinoma. The aim of this study was to revise the non-genetic risk factors that may influence the development of OC, while focusing on the dental and periodontal status and OH. Methods: Two hundred patients (hundred diagnosed with oral cancer and hundred without oral cancer) were enrolled in our case–control study, to evaluate the association between oral cancer and the presence and severity of periodontitis, while examining several risk factors that might be responsible for oral cancer formation. A questionnaire customised for oral cancer patients was used to obtain the socioeconomic and lifestyle risk factors that may influence the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma. The dental and periodontal status along with the level of oral hygiene was recorded quantitatively. The chi-square and Mann–Whitney tests and logistic regression were used for the statistical analysis. Results: By considering both the case and the control groups, a significant correlation was found between the incidence of oral cancer and some socioeconomic factors and lifestyle habits, such as the sex, age, education and alcohol consumption of an individual. The mean value of the Silness-Löe plaque index was significantly higher in the case population. The number of completely edentulous patients was higher among the oral cancer population. The incidence of oral cancer was 57.1% in patients with periodontal disease. In comparison, the incidence of oral squamous cell carcinoma was only 28.6% among the patients without periodontitis. Most of the oral cancer patients (72.1%) had stage 4 periodontitis. On the other hand, the vast majority of the control group (51.6%) had stage 2 periodontitis. Conclusion: Periodontitis can be an individual risk factor for oral cancer development. Periodontally compromised individuals should be strictly monitored, especially those with severe periodontitis and coexisting lifestyle risk factors. Maintaining their periodontal health in at-risk patients can minimize cancer risks. © 2021, The Author(s).","Oral cancer; Periodontal disease; Risk factors","Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Case-Control Studies; Humans; Mouth Neoplasms; Periodontal Index; Periodontitis; Risk Factors; case control study; complication; human; mouth tumor; periodontal index; periodontitis; risk factor; squamous cell carcinoma","","","","","Semmelweis Egyetem","","Dhull A.K., Atri R., Dhankhar R., Chauhan A.K., Kaushal V., Major risk factors in head and neck cancer: a retrospective analysis of 12-year experiences, World J Oncol, 9, pp. 80-84, (2018); Ferlay J., Colombet M., Soerjomataram I., Mathers C., Parkin D.M., Pineros M., Et al., Estimating the global cancer incidence and mortality in 2018: GLOBOCAN sources and methods, Int J Cancer, 144, pp. 1941-1953, (2019); Conway D.I., Purkayastha M., Chestnutt I.G., The changing epidemiology of oral cancer: Definitions, trends, and risk factors, Br Dent J, 225, (2018); Johnson N.W., Jayasekara P., Amarasinghe A.A., Hemantha K., Squamous cell carcinoma and precursor lesions of the oral cavity: Epidemiology and aetiology, Periodontol, 2011, 57, pp. 19-37, (2000); Azimi S., Rafieian N., Manifar S., Ghorbani Z., Tennant M., Kruger E., Socioeconomic determinants as risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: a case-control study in Iran, Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg, 56, pp. 304-309, (2018); Hashim D., Sartori S., Brennan P., Curado M.P., Wunsch-Filho V., Divaris K., Et al., The role of oral hygiene in head and neck cancer: Results from International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology (INHANCE) consortium, Ann Oncol, 27, pp. 1619-1625, (2016); Hussein A.A., Helder M.N., de Visscher J.G., Leemans C.R., Braakhuis B.J., de Vet H.C.W., Et al., Global incidence of oral and oropharynx cancer in patients younger than 45 years versus older patients: a systematic review, Eur J Cancer, 82, pp. 115-127, (2017); Gupta B., Bray F., Kumar N., Johnson N.W., Associations between oral hygiene habits, diet, tobacco and alcohol and risk of oral cancer: a case–control study from India, Cancer Epidemiol, 51, pp. 7-14, (2017); Ali H., Sinnott S.J., Corcoran P., Deady S., Sharp L., Kabir Z., Oral cancer incidence and survival rates in the Republic of Ireland, 1994–2009, BMC Cancer, 16, pp. 1-7, (2016); Javed F., Warnakulasuriya S., Is there a relationship between periodontal disease and oral cancer?

This study aimed to explore this relationship. This nested case–control study analyzed data from 10,174 patients with gastric cancer and 40,696 controls from the Korean National Health Insurance Service–National Sample Cohort using propensity score matching. Standardized differences were used to compare baseline characteristics between study groups. Logistic regression analyses adjusted for confounders were conducted to assess the association between history of CP and gastric cancer occurrence. CP histories and comprehensive subgroup analyses in the 1- and 2-year periods preceding the index date were evaluated. Individuals with a history of CP within the 1-year and 2-year periods showed an increased likelihood of developing gastric cancer. Subgroup analyses consistently supported these findings in male participants aged <65 years and individuals with various income levels or living in residential areas. However, no significant associations were observed among participants aged ≥65 years. In conclusion, CP may be a potential risk factor for gastric cancer development in the Korean population. Regular screening for gastric cancer may be necessary for high-risk individuals, specifically men aged <65 years with a history of CP. © 2023 by the authors.","chronic periodontitis; gastric cancer; national healthcare data; nested case–control study","adolescent; adult; age; aged; Article; cancer patient; cancer risk; cancer screening; case control study; child; chronic periodontitis; cohort analysis; confounding variable; controlled study; data analysis; dental health; disease association; disease course; female; gender; high risk population; human; Korean (people); logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; medical history; middle aged; national health insurance; observational study; personal income; preschool child; propensity score; public health; residential area; retrospective study; sample; stomach cancer; very elderly; young adult","","","","","NRF-2022R1G1A1012542; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2022R1F1A1065335, 2022R1G1A1012542); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This research was funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant of the Korea government (MSIT) (no. 2022R1G1A1012542 to Hyun Lim and no. 2022R1F1A1065335 to Mi Jung Kwon).

While studies have shown that poor oral health might increase the risk of lung cancer, the veracity of these reports is questionable. Therefore, this meta-analysis was undertaken to investigate the association between PD and the risk of lung cancer. A search was run in PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases up to January 1, 2020. Cohort and case-control studies investigating the correlation between PD and lung cancer were included. Eligibility assessment and data extraction were conducted independently, and a meta-analysis was performed to synthesize the data. The association between PD, edentulism, and lung cancer was measured by the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) provided in articles. We employed appropriate effect model in terms of I2 (a fixed-effect model for PD and a random-effect model for edentulism) to obtain summary effect estimates. Statistical heterogeneity was investigated by chi-square test and I2 statistics. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of their method. Six cohort studies (eight references) and two case-control studies, assessed as high-quality, involving 167 256 participants, were included in the review. The summary estimates based on adjusted data showed an association between PD and a significant risk of lung cancer both in cohort studies (HR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.25-1.58; I2 = 8.7%) and case-control studies (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.16-1.98; I2 = 36.5%). Similar features were found in the sensitivity analysis and subgroups for six cohort studies, of male only (HR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.15-2.60), setting the lung cancer incidence as endpoint (HR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.24-1.57; I2 = 23.9%), and adjusting alcohol for multifactorial HR (HR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.21-1.57; I2 = 39.9%). The summary HR for edentulism was 1.93 (95% CI = 1.05-3.57; I2 = 55.3%). No obvious publication bias was detected. This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated a significant association between PD and the incidence of lung cancer. Further observational studies are required by using standardized measurements to assess the periodontal status and by eliminating confounding factors, such as alcohol and diabetes, to verify such a relationship. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Indeed, dysbiosis of the oral microbiome and immune-inflammatory pathways related to periodontitis may impact the pathophysiology of the gastrointestinal tract and its accessory organs through the so-called “gum–gut axis”. In addition to the hematogenous spread of periodontal pathogens and inflammatory cytokines, recent research suggests that oral pathobionts may translocate to the gastrointestinal tract through saliva, possibly impacting neoplastic processes in the gastrointestinal, liver, and pancreatic systems. The exact mechanisms by which oral pathogens contribute to the development of digestive tract cancers are not fully understood but may involve dysbiosis of the gut microbiome, chronic inflammation, and immune modulation/evasion, mainly through the interaction with T-helper and monocytic cells. Specifically, keystone periodontal pathogens, including Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, are known to interact with the molecular hallmarks of gastrointestinal cancers, inducing genomic mutations, and promote a permissive immune microenvironment by impairing anti-tumor checkpoints. The evidence gathered here suggests a possible role of periodontitis and oral dysbiosis in the carcinogenesis of the enteral tract. The “gum–gut axis” may therefore represent a promising target for the development of strategies for the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. © 2023 by the authors.","digestive system diseases; malignancies; neoplasms; oral bacteria; pancreatic cancer; periodontal diseases; periodontal medicine; risk factors; systemic inflammation","beta catenin; cadherin; carcinogen; CXCL1 chemokine; gelatinase B; interleukin 8; neutrophil collagenase; seprase; toll like receptor 4; tumor necrosis factor; uvomorulin; Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; cancer prevention; cancer risk; canonical Wnt signaling; carcinogenesis; cell proliferation; chronic inflammation; colorectal cancer; digestive system cancer; dysbiosis; enteropathy; esophagus cancer; Fusobacterium nucleatum; gastrointestinal cancer; gastrointestinal tract; genomic mutation; gingival tissue; helper cell; human; immune evasion; immunomodulation; intestine; intestine flora; liver cancer; MAPK signaling; microbiome; monocyte; monocyte like cell; mouth flora; mouth hygiene; NF kB signaling; pancreas cancer; pathogenesis; periodontitis; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Review; risk factor; stomach cancer; systemic inflammatory response syndrome; Treponema denticola; tumor microenvironment","","gelatinase B, 146480-36-6; interleukin 8, 114308-91-7; neutrophil collagenase, ; toll like receptor 4, 203811-83-0; uvomorulin, 112956-45-3","","","","","Arnold M., Abnet C.C., Neale R.E., Vignat J., Giovannucci E.L., McGlynn K.A., Bray F., Global Burden of 5 Major Types of Gastrointestinal Cancer, Gastroenterology, 159, (2020); Sung H., Ferlay J., Siegel R.L., Laversanne M., Soerjomataram I., Jemal A., Bray F., Global Cancer Statistics 2020: GLOBOCAN Estimates of Incidence and Mortality Worldwide for 36 Cancers in 185 Countries, CA Cancer J.

More than 50 systemic inflammatory disorders and comorbidities are associated with periodontitis, many of which overlap with immunotherapy-associated toxicities. Despite the increasing use of immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer, uncertainty remains as to whether the microbial shift associated with periodontal disease can influence response rates and tolerance to cancer immunotherapy. We herein review the pathophysiology of periodontitis and the local and systemic inflammatory conditions related to oral dysbiosis, and discuss the overlapping adverse profiles of periodontitis and immunotherapy. The effects of the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a key pathogen in periodontitis, highlight how the oral microbiome can affect the hosts’ systemic immune responses, and further research into the local and systemic influence of other microorganisms causing periodontal disease is necessary. Addressing periodontitis in an ageing population of people with cancer could have potential implications for the clinical response to (and tolerability of) immunotherapy and warrants further investigation. © 2023 The Author(s).

In this study, we prospectively evaluated the association of periodontal disease severity with cancer risk in black and white older adults in a cohort study that included a dental examination. Methods: Included were 7466 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study cohort who at visit 4 (1996-1998) reported being edentulous or underwent the dental examination. Probing depth and gingival recession were measured at six sites on all teeth; these measurements were used to define periodontal disease severity. Incident cancers (n=1648) and cancer deaths (n=547) were ascertained during a median of 14.7 years of follow-up. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: An increased risk of total cancer (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07 to 1.44, Ptrend = .004) was observed for severe periodontitis (>30% of sites with attachment loss >3 mm) compared with no/mild periodontitis (<10% of sites with attachment loss >3 mm), adjusting for smoking and other factors. Strong associations were observed for lung cancer (HR=2.33, 95% CI=1.51 to 3.60, Ptrend < .001), and elevated risks were noted for colorectal cancer for severe periodontitis, which were significant among never smokers (HR=2.12, 95% CI=1.00 to 4.47). Associations were generally weaker, or not apparent among black participants, except for lung and colorectal cancers, where associations were similar by race. No associations were observed for breast, prostate, or hematopoietic and lymphatic cancer risk. Conclusions: This study provides additional evidence that cancer risk, especially for lung and colorectal cancer, is elevated in individuals with periodontitis. Additional research is needed to understand cancer site-specific and racial differences in findings. © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

So, there is a need for an extensive meta-analysis with the total articles published until 2020. Hence, this study aimed to estimate the association between HNC and OHS-P through a meta-analysis. Methods: Based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses guidelines, 22 studies were selected through PubMed and Cochrane Library databases. Meta-analysis using them was performed to evaluate the association. The risk of bias assessment using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was applied to evaluate the quality of non-randomized studies. Publication bias was evaluated by funnel plot and Egger's regression test. Results: Since heterogeneity was signifcant (I2 = 88%, P < 0.001), we adopted the random efect model for 22 studies. Those with bad OHS-P, compared to those with good OHS-P, were more likely to have the risk of HNC by 2.4 times (odds ratio [OR], 2.42; 95% confdence interval [CI], 1.88-3.13) for random efect model. The association included publication bias (Egger's regression, P value < 0.001). The association among fve studies (I2 = 39%, P = 0.16) using alveolar bone loss (ABL) or clinical attachment level (CAL) for assessing periodontitis increased to OR of 3.85 (CI, 3.04-4.88) in the fxed efect model without publication bias (Egger's regression, P = 0.66). Moreover, the association was higher in 10 fair or good NOS studies (OR, 3.08) and in 7 Asian studies (OR, 2.68), which were from the fxed model without publication bias. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis showed that bad OHS-P was associated with the risk of HNC. The association was stronger in studies using ABL or CAL for assessing periodontitis. © 2021 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.","Head and Neck Cancer; Meta-analysis; Oral Health Status; Periodontitis","Alcohol Drinking; Databases, Factual; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Heart Disease Risk Factors; Humans; Odds Ratio; Oral Health; Periodontitis; Smoking; drinking behavior; factual database; head and neck tumor; health; human; meta analysis; odds ratio; pathology; periodontitis; smoking","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (NRF-2017M3A9B6062984); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This study was supported by the Bio & Medical Technology Development Program of the National Research Foundation (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT, Korea (NRF-2017M3A9B6062984).","Mehanna H, Paleri V, West CM, Nutting C., Head and neck cancer–part 1: epidemiology, presentation, and prevention, BMJ, 341, (2010); Warnakulasuriya S., Global epidemiology of oral and oropharyngeal cancer, Oral Oncol, 45, 4-5, pp. 309-316, (2009); Blot WJ, McLaughlin JK, Winn DM, Austin DF, Greenberg RS, Preston-Martin S, Et al., Smoking and drinking in relation to oral and pharyngeal cancer, Cancer Res, 48, 11, pp. 3282-3287, (1988); Rusin P, Markiewicz L, Majsterek I., Genetic predeterminations of head and neck cancer, Postepy Hig Med Dosw, 62, pp. 490-501, (2008); Chasen MR, Bhargava R., A descriptive review of the factors contributing to nutritional compromise in patients with head and neck cancer, Support Care Cancer, 17, 11, pp. 1345-1351, (2009); Buglione M, Cavagnini R, Di Rosario F, Sottocornola L, Maddalo M, Vassalli L, Et al., Oral toxicity management in head and neck cancer patients treated with chemotherapy and radiation: Dental pathologies and osteoradionecrosis (Part 1) literature review and consensus statement, Crit Rev Oncol Hematol, 97, pp. 131-142, (2016); Zheng TZ, Boyle P, Hu HF, Duan J, Jian PJ, Ma DQ, Et al., Dentition, oral hygiene, and risk of oral cancer: a case-control study in Beijing, People's Republic of China, Cancer Causes Control, 1, 3, pp. 235-241, (1990); Eliot MN, Michaud DS, Langevin SM, McClean MD, Kelsey KT., Periodontal disease and mouthwash use are risk factors for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, Cancer Causes Control, 24, 7, pp. 1315-1322, (2013); Javed F, Warnakulasuriya S., Is there a relationship between periodontal disease and oral cancer?

However, other causes of oral inflammation exist, which can resemble plaque-induced gingivitis and periodontitis, and may thus first be seen by a dental practitioner. This paper aims to provide dentists with an understanding of the manifestations of systemic diseases to the periodontium and highlights anamnestic and clinical clues important for distinguishing between plaque-induced and non plaque-induced lesions. In the first part of this series immune-mediated and hereditary conditions as causes of gingival lesions were discussed; this second part highlights cancer-related gingival lesions as well as those caused by specific pathogens, medication or malnutrition. A clear clinical, epidemiological and visual overview of the different conditions is provided. Early diagnosis of non plaque-related causes of gingival lesions can be vital for affected patients.

Methods: Included were 1263 men aged ≥ 40 years who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2009–2010. Measurements of periodontal health and tooth count were used to define periodontal disease severity (no, mild, moderate, severe) and edentulism. Linear and logistic regressions were used to estimate the association of periodontal disease severity and edentulism with PSA concentration and elevated PSA, respectively. Results: Adjusting for age and other factors including race, body mass index, and education, the natural logarithm of PSA concentration did not change with increasing severity (mild − 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] − 0.34 to − 0.05; moderate − 0.12, 95% CI − 0.26 to 0.01; severe − 0.16, 95% CI − 0.43 to 0.12; edentulism − 0.16, 95% CI − 0.35 to 0.04; P-trend 0.13) compared with dentate men without periodontal disease. Although the multivariable-adjusted ORs of elevated PSA were not statistically significant, participants with more severe periodontal disease were less likely to have PSA > 2.0 and > 2.5 ng/mL, but more likely to have PSA > 4.0 ng/mL, compared to dentate men without periodontal disease. Similar non-significant associations with PSA were observed when comparing edentulous men to dentate men without periodontal disease. Conclusions: In this US nationally representative sample, men with periodontal disease did not have higher serum PSA and were not more likely to have clinically elevated PSA after taking into account age and other factors, contrary to the hypothesis. This study suggests that periodontal disease does not notably affect the specificity of PSA for prostate cancer screening. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Men; NHANES; Periodontal disease; PSA","Adult; Aged; Body Mass Index; Early Detection of Cancer; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; Periodontal Diseases; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; prostate specific antigen; prostate specific antigen; adult; age; aged; Article; body mass; cancer diagnosis; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; concentration (parameter); controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease association; disease severity; educational status; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; periodontal disease; prevalence; priority journal; prostate biopsy; prostate cancer; race; tooth; blood; early cancer diagnosis; middle aged; nutrition; periodontal disease; prostate tumor; statistical model","","Prostate-Specific Antigen, ","","","Maryland Cigarette Restitution Fund; National Cancer Institute, NCI, (P30CA006973); Johns Hopkins University, JHU"," This work was supported in part by the National Cancer Institute (P30 CA006973, Nelson) and the Maryland Cigarette Restitution Fund at Johns Hopkins.

Furthermore, it remains controversial as to whether improving the periodontal condition of patients with lung and esophageal cancer before surgery reduces the incidence of POP. This retrospective study was conducted to assess the effects of periodontal therapy in patients with lung and esophageal cancer to prevent POP. Methods: A total of 265 patients with lung or esophageal cancer complicated with chronic periodontitis who underwent open thoracotomy between July 2015 and June 2019 were selected and given the choice of being in the experimental or control group. A total of 141 participants in the experimental group received periodontal therapy, and 124 participants in the control group did not receive periodontal therapy. All clinical data of participants in both groups were retrospectively studied to determine the incidence of POP on the 30th day after discharge from hospital. Results: Eight patients in the experimental and six in the control group, respectively, were excluded from the study. It was found that four of the 133 patients suffered from POP in the experimental group (incidence: 3.01%). A total of 18 of 118 patients in the control group had a pulmonary infection (incidence: 15.25%). POP incidence in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in the control group, and in the level analysis of different types of periodontitis, surgical methods, and diseases (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Periodontal treatment is associated with a lower incidence of POP following lung and esophageal cancer surgery. Improving the periodontal condition of patients helps prevent POP. The presence of periodontitis is an important predisposing factor for POP in patients after open thoracotomy. Periodontal examination and therapy are recommended before the surgical treatment of lung or esophageal cancer. © 2021 The Authors.

Recent advances in technology and cost reduction of sequencing have made it possible and much easier for researchers to investigate the role of the microbiome in carcinogenesis. Furthermore, modulation of microflora may serve as an effective adjunct to conventional anticancer therapy that is very important to improve the patient’s quality of life. Additionally, microbiome biomarkers can also be used as a diagnostic tool for cancer. So far the association between oral microbial consortia and their interactions with the host in maintaining the human health and the pathogenesis of multiple cancers has gained much popularity in the scientific research community. While the interactions of oral microflora are better established in cancer-like gastric cancer, it is far less understood in others like breast cancer. Therefore, this review briefly outlines the current information on the role of oral microbiota in breast cancer with emphasis on the mechanisms of oral microflora induced carcinogenesis and discusses the emerging role of periodontitis as a risk factor for breast cancer. Clinical relevance; Periodontitis is a very common disease that is characterized by chronic polymicrobial infection and inflammation of gingiva. It might be associated as a risk factor for breast cancer. If this association is validated in large cohort studies, it would serve as a non-invasive biomarker for breast cancer. © 2021.

The aim of this study was to assess the association between periodontitis and all-cause mortality, and all-cancer and specific cancers’ mortality in a health examination cohort of the elderly in the communities. Methods: A dataset of health examinations for the elderly with cause of death from 2005 to 2012 was obtained from the Department of Health, Taipei City Government. We enrolled 82,548 study participants with 262,035 visits. A Cox proportional hazards model and Cox frailty model were used for calculating the hazard ratios under different periodontal status by using SAS and Rstudio. Results: Being male, elderly, having a low education level, and smoking were risk factors for mortality in this retrospective elderly community cohort study. Participants with periodontitis followed across time had significantly higher hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality and all-cancer mortality (HR = 1.092, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.038 to 1.149, HR = 1.114, 95% CI:1.032 to 1.203, respectively) in the Cox frailty models after adjusting for age, marital status, education level, sex, and smoking status. After adjusting for age and sex, the hazard ratio was 1.185 (95% CI: 1.027 to 1.368) for lung cancer mortality, and 1.340 (95% CI: 1.019 to 1.762) for prostate cancer mortality in the periodontitis group with each visit. Conclusions: The findings indicated that being male, having a low education level, and daily smoking were risk factors for mortality, and showed mixed evidence that periodontal disease is associated with all-cause, all-cancer and specific-cancer mortality including lung and prostate cancer. We suggest the importance of regular health screening in order to achieve early disease detection and lower mortality risk. © The Author(s). 2020 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.","Cancer; Mortality; Periodontitis; Smoking","Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Mortality; Neoplasms; Periodontitis; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; aged; female; human; male; mortality; neoplasm; periodontitis; proportional hazards model; retrospective study; risk factor","","","","","","","Loesche W.J., Grossman N.S., Periodontal disease as a specific, albeit chronic, infection: Diagnosis and treatment, Clin Microbiol Rev, 14, 4, pp. 727-752, (2001); Grinde B., Olsen I., The role of viruses in oral disease, J Oral Microbiol, (2010); Janket S.J., Baird A.E., Chuang S.K., Jones J.A., Meta-analysis of periodontal disease and risk of coronary heart disease and stroke, Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod, 95, 5, pp. 559-569, (2003); Kinane D.F., Marshall G.J., Periodontal manifestations of systemic disease, Aust Dent J, 46, 1, pp. 2-12, (2001); Shen T.C., Chang P.Y., Lin C.L., Chen C.H., Tu C.Y., Hsia T.C., Et al., Risk of periodontal diseases in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A nationwide population-based cohort study, Medicine, 94, 46, (2015); Ricardo A.C., Athavale A., Chen J., Hampole H., Garside D., Marucha P., Et al., Periodontal disease, chronic kidney disease and mortality: Results from the third National Health and nutrition examination survey, BMC Nephrol, 16, (2015); Hujoel P.P., Drangsholt M., Spiekerman C., Weiss N.S., An exploration of the periodontitis-cancer association, Ann Epidemiol, 13, 5, pp. 312-316, (2003); Abnet C.C., Kamangar F., Islami F., Nasrollahzadeh D., Brennan P., Aghcheli K., Et al., Tooth loss and lack of regular oral hygiene are associated with higher risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev, 17, 11, pp. 3062-3068, (2008); Heikkila P., But A., Sorsa T., Haukka J., Periodontitis and cancer mortality: Register-based cohort study of 68,273 adults in 10-year follow-up, Int J Cancer, 142, 11, pp. 2244-2253, (2018); Michaud D.S., Liu Y., Meyer M., Giovannucci E., Joshipura K., Periodontal disease, tooth loss, and cancer risk in Male health professionals: A prospective cohort study, Lancet Oncol, 9, 6, pp. 550-558, (2008); Migliorati C.A., Periodontal diseases and cancer, Lancet Oncol, 9, 6, pp. 510-512, (2008); Mantovani A., Allavena P., Sica A., Balkwill F., Cancer-related inflammation, Nature, 454, 7203, pp. 436-444, (2008); Hoare A., Soto C., Rojas-Celis V., Bravo D., Chronic inflammation as a link between periodontitis and carcinogenesis, Mediat Inflamm, 2019, (2019); Kassebaum N.J., Bernabe E., Dahiya M., Bhandari B., Murray C.J., Marcenes W., Global burden of severe periodontitis in 1990-2010: A systematic review and meta-regression, J Dent Res, 93, 11, pp. 1045-1053, (2014); Bernabe E., Marcenes W., Hernandez C.R., Bailey J., Abreu L.G., Alipour V., Et al., Global, regional, and national levels and trends in burden of oral conditions from 1990 to 2017: A systematic analysis for the global burden of disease 2017 study, J Dent Res, 99, 4, pp. 362-373, (2020); Yu H.C., Su N.Y., Huang J.Y., Lee S.S., Chang Y.C., Trends in the prevalence of periodontitis in Taiwan from 1997 to 2013: A nationwide population-based retrospective study, Medicine, 96, 45, (2017); Lai H., Su C.W., Yen A.M., Chiu S.Y., Fann J.C., Wu W.Y., Et al., A prediction model for periodontal disease: Modelling and validation from a national survey of 4061 Taiwanese adults, J Clin Periodontol, 42, 5, pp. 413-421, (2015); Ainamo J., Barmes D., Beagrie G., Cutress T., Martin J., Sardo-Infirri J., Development of the World Health Organization (WHO) community periodontal index of treatment needs (CPITN), Int Dent J, 32, 3, pp. 281-291, (1982); Visscher C.M., Lobbezoo F., Schuller A.A., Dental status and oral health-related quality of life.

In this narrative review, we update the knowledge about gingival dysbiosis and the charac-teristics of Fusobacterium nucleatum as one of the main bacteria related to periodontitis. We provide data on microbiome, epidemiology, risk factors, prognosis, and treatment of colorectal cancer, one of the most frequent tumours diagnosed and whose incidence increases every year. We describe, from its recent origin, the relationship between this bacterium and this type of cancer and the knowledge and emerging mechanisms that scientific evidence reveals in an updated way. A diagram provided synthesizes the pathogenic mechanisms of this relationship in a comprehensive manner. Finally, the main questions and further research perspectives are presented. © 2022 by the authors.

To elucidate the clinical significance of oral care, we investigated the relationship between the oral environment and postoperative infectious complications (POICs) in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery. Methods: This was a single-institute and historical cohort study of 341 patients. The participants were isolated from consecutive patients undergoing planned radical resection for gastrointestinal carcinoma from January 2016 to June 2017. Dentists assessed the oral environment for periodontal disease, hygiene status, dry mouth, fur on tongue, and tooth stumps. All patients received scaling and tooth brushing instructions. A stepwise logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify risk factors for POICs among the different oral statuses. Results: The surgical procedures performed were gastrectomy in 123 (36.1%), colorectal resection in 185 (54.2%), and pancreatoduodenectomy or others in 38 (11.1%). POICs occurred in 48 patients (14.1%), including deep organ space infection in 20, surgical site infection in 11, anastomotic leakage in 5, urinary tract infection in 4, pneumonia in 2, and others in 6. After adjusting for confounding factors, periodontal disease was isolated as an independent risk factor for POICs (odds ratio 2.091, p = 0.037, 95% confidence interval 1.045–4.183). Other variables of oral environment such as hygiene status, dry mouth, fur on tongue, and tooth stumps did not have a significant impact on POICs. Conclusions: Periodontal disease is a risk factor for infectious complications after gastrointestinal surgery. © 2019, Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.","Infectious complication; Oncological surgery; Periodontal disease; Perioperative oral management","Aged; Antibiotic Prophylaxis; Cohort Studies; Female; Gastrectomy; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Periodontal Diseases; Pneumonia; Postoperative Complications; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome; Urinary Tract Infections; adult; aged; anastomosis leakage; Article; cancer patient; cohort analysis; colorectal surgery; dental scaling; dentist; digestive system cancer; disease severity; female; gastrectomy; gastrointestinal carcinoma; human; infectious complication; major clinical study; male; mouth hygiene; pancreaticoduodenectomy; periodontal disease; pneumonia; postoperative complication; postoperative infection; priority journal; radical resection; risk factor; surgical infection; tongue disease; tooth brushing; urinary tract infection; xerostomia; adverse event; antibiotic prophylaxis; complication; gastrointestinal tumor; middle aged; periodontal disease; pneumonia; postoperative complication; treatment outcome; urinary tract infection","","","","","","","Bergan E.H., Tura B.R., Lamas C.C., Impact of improvement in preoperative oral health on nosocomial pneumonia in a group of cardiac surgery patients: a single arm prospective intervention study, Intensive Care Med, 40, 1, pp. 23-31, (2014); Spreadborough P., Lort S., Pasquali S., Et al., A systematic review and meta-analysis of perioperative oral decontamination in patients undergoing major elective surgery, Perioperative medicine, 5, (2016); Sato J., Goto J., Harahashi A., Et al., Oral health care reduces the risk of postoperative surgical site infection in inpatients with oral squamous cell carcinoma, Support Care Cancer, 19, 3, pp. 409-416, (2011); Bebko S.P., Green D.M., Awad S.S., Effect of a preoperative decontamination protocol on surgical site infections in patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery with hardware implantation, JAMA Surg, 150, 5, pp. 390-395, (2015); Wilson W., Taubert K.A., Gewitz M., Et al., Prevention of infective endocarditis: guidelines from the American Heart Association: a guideline from the American Heart Association Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease Committee, Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young, and the Council on Clinical Cardiology, Council on Cardiovascular Surgery and Anesthesia, and the Quality of Care and Outcomes Research Interdisciplinary Working Group, Circulation, 116, 15, pp. 1736-1754, (2007); Yoneyama T., Yoshida M., Matsui T., Et al., Oral care and pneumonia.

Our objective was to identify candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with PD in radiation-treated patients with HNC. Study Design: DNA was extracted from the saliva of patients with HNC (n = 69) before RT. Clinical attachment loss (CAL) increment greater than 0.2 mm over 24 months after RT was used to define PD progression. After exome sequencing, SNPs associated with post-RT PD progression were identified by using logistic regression and homozygosity analyses. The web tools STRING, the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), GeneCodis, and Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor were used for functional analysis. Results: Of the 48 patients with HNC with post-RT PD progression, 24 had no tooth with 5 mm or greater pocket depth before RT, whereas of the 21 patients with HNC without progression, 11 had PD initially. A total of 330 SNPs (249 genes) with over-represented homozygous genotype (98.5% variant allele) were found to be associated with post-RT PD. Sixty of these corresponded to PD-related pathways, including previously identified genes. In patients with HNC with post-RT PD progression, SNPs were found in genes (n = 10) in contrast to those without progression (n = 7). Conclusions: The SNPs of collagen genes were identified, potentially defining susceptibility to PD in patients with HNC, and this could be further investigated to characterize PD drug targets. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","","Exome; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Nucleotides; Periodontal Diseases; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; nucleotide; exome; head and neck tumor; human; periodontal disease; single nucleotide polymorphism","","Nucleotides, ","","","Atrium Health Foundation; Biostatistics Division at the University of Minnesota","Funding text 1: We are thankful to all those who contributed to this study: clinical staff at Carolinas Center for Oral Health at Atrium Health and University of Connecticut Health in Farmington, for performing CT for patient recruitment and saliva sample collection; Dr. James Hodges and other members of the Biostatistics Division at the University of Minnesota, for collection and preliminary analysis of clinical and demographic data; oral medicine research and molecular service core laboratories at Atrium Health, for saliva samples processing, exome sequencing, and providing the VCF files; and Dr. Xinghua Shi for her helpful discussion at the initial planning of the SNP analysis.

These relationships may vary by country or race=ethnicity. We aimed to systematically review studies in this field conducted with the Japanese population because such a review in the Japanese population has never been undertaken. Methods: We conducted systematic literature searches in PubMed and Ichushi-Web databases for studies published until December 2016. Studies comparing the incidence and=or prevalence of the comorbidities among the Japanese population were included. The studies were classified as integrated analyses, cohort studies, case-control studies, or cross-sectional studies. Results: We identified 33 studies (cancer: 17, periodontal disease: 5, fracture: 5, cognitive impairment: 4, and depression: 2). Although several cohort studies and meta-analyses had assessed the development of cancer in diabetes, there was scant epidemiological evidence for the other conditions. Indeed, only one cohort study each had been conducted for periodontal disease, fracture, and cognitive impairment, whereas other evidence was cross-sectional, some of which was induced from baseline characteristic tables of studies designed for other purposes. Conclusion: In Japan, there is insufficient evidence about the relationship between diabetes and the incidence=prevalence of periodontal disease, fracture, cognitive impairment, and depression. By contrast, several cohort studies and integrated analyses have been conducted for the relationship with cancer. Further studies should be undertaken to estimate the contribution of diabetes on the incidence=prevalence of comorbidities that may be specific to the Japanese population. © 2018 Hirokazu Tanaka et al.","Diabetes complications; Diabetes mellitus; Epidemiological studies; Japan; Review","Cognitive Dysfunction; Comorbidity; Depression; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Incidence; Japan; Neoplasms; Periodontal Diseases; Prevalence; cognitive defect; comorbidity; depression; diabetes mellitus; diabetic complication; fracture; human; incidence; Japan; neoplasm; periodontal disease; prevalence","","","","","National Center for Global Health and Medicine, NCGM","This study was supported by grants from the National Center for Global Health and Medicine (26-s002).

Identification of biomarkers is useful for the prevention, diagnosis and prognosis of diseases as well as for monitoring the progression of pathological disorders. Several types of molecules present in biological fluids can act as biomarkers such as DNA, coding and non-coding RNA, lipids, metabolites, proteins and even microbes. In this context, saliva emerges as a useful diagnostic tool for the detection of biomarkers involved with oral and systemic diseases, since it reflects the pathophysiological conditions of the organism and allows early, rapid, practical and noninvasive detection of biomarkers. Areas covered: This review discusses the properties of saliva as a diagnostic tool and addresses the main identified biomarkers related to dental caries, periodontal disease, head and neck cancer and other types of cancer of considerable incidence among the world population. Expert commentary: Despite extensive efforts which have been directed toward the identification of one or a combination of biomarkers with good predictive values for the early detection of dental caries, periodontal disease and cancer, these biomarkers still need validation before chairside point-of-care devices can be widely used in the clinic. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Biomarkers; cancer; dental caries; diagnosis; periodontal disease; saliva","Biomarkers; Dental Caries; Disease Susceptibility; Humans; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Neoplasms; Periodontal Diseases; Point-of-Care Systems; Prognosis; Saliva; biological marker; breast cancer; dental caries; head and neck cancer; human; incidence; pancreas cancer; periodontal disease; Review; saliva; stomach cancer; dental caries; disease predisposition; metabolism; molecular diagnosis; neoplasm; periodontal disease; point of care system; prognosis; saliva","","Biomarkers, ","","","Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES","The authors thank FAPESP for the concession of scholarship to TSC, SMM, TTA, FNR and NRB and CAPES for the concession of scholarship to SOMF.

Materials and Methods: A healthy non-periodontitis group (H-NP; n = 20), a systemically healthy chronic periodontitis group (H-P; n = 20), a non-periodontitis group with OC (OC-NP; n = 12), and a chronic periodontitis group with OC (OC-P; n = 16) formed the study groups. The levels of NE and IGFBP7 were measured in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and saliva. In addition, oxidative status was determined by evaluating total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS), and OSI (TOS/TAS). Results: Gingival crevicular fluid NE was higher in all the groups compared with the H-NP group (p '.01). Salivary NE was higher in the OC-P and H-P groups compared with the H-NP and OC-NP groups (p '.05). Salivary IGFBP7 was significantly higher in the OC-NP and OC-P groups compared with the H-NP and H-P groups (p '.001). GCF TOS and OSI levels were significantly higher in all groups compared with the H-NP group (p '.05). Conclusions: Gingival crevicular fluid NE levels were lower in healthy conditions compared with periodontal disease and OC. Salivary NE levels were higher in periodontal disease compared to states with no periodontal disease. Salivary IGFBP7 levels were higher in OC. Further analyses may help determine whether high salivary IGFBP7 levels distinguish OC from healthy conditions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The purpose of the present systematic review was to analyze the current evidence regarding the potential association between periodontitis and/or tooth loss and the risk of liver cancer. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases was conducted in August 2019. The inclusion criteria comprised all observational studies that assessed the relationship between periodontitis or tooth loss and liver cancer. Case reports, animal studies, experimental studies, and reviews were excluded. Due to great heterogeneity among the included studies, no meta-analysis was conducted. Six studies (five prospective cohorts and one case-control) comprising 619,834 subjects (including 916 liver cancer cases) were included. The studies were conducted in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Three large-scale cohort studies reported a positive association between periodontitis or tooth loss and the risk of liver cancer. One case-control study found some association between liver cancer and loss of 12−23 teeth, but such association was not replicated in patients with greater number of tooth loss. Contrarily, two studies failed to report any association between periodontitis and/or tooth loss and the risk of liver cancer. The available evidence suggests a possible link between tooth loss/periodontitis and the risk of liver cancer. However, the evidence is not conclusive enough, a fact that drives to conduct more, well-designed, prospective cohort studies to further explore the potential association between periodontitis and the risk of liver cancer. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Association; Liver cancer; Periodontitis; Tooth loss","Animals; Asia; Case-Control Studies; Europe; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Periodontitis; Prospective Studies; Tooth Loss; age distribution; Asia; cancer risk; data base; data extraction; disease association; Europe; human; liver cancer; periodontal disease; periodontitis; quality control; Review; risk assessment; statistical analysis; study design; systematic review; United States; animal; case control study; complication; liver tumor; periodontal disease; periodontitis; prospective study","","","","","","","Ahn J., Segers S., Hayes R.B., Periodontal disease, Porphyromonas gingivalis serum antibody levels and orodigestive cancer mortality, Carcinogenesis, 33, pp. 1055-1058, (2012); Ahn J., Chen C.Y., Hayes R.B., Oral microbiome and oral and gastrointestinal cancer risk, Cancer Causes Control, 23, pp. 399-404, (2012); Alakhali M.S., Al-Maweri S.A., The potential association between periodontitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review, Clin.

The immune-inflammatory responses play essential roles in the patient susceptibility to periodontal diseases. There is a wealth of evidence indicating a link between chronic inflammation and risk of malignant transformation of the affected oral epithelium. Periodontitis is associated with an increased risk of developing chronic systemic conditions including autoimmune diseases and different types of cancers. Besides, some risk factors such as smoking , alcohol consumption and human papilloma virus have been found to be associated with both periodontitis and oral cancer.

Periodontitis may be a precipitating factor for tumorigenesis and the aggressiveness of specific cancer variants. Although genetics is considered the primary etiologic factor for the development of most cancers, many factors have come to be recognized in the initiation and progression of oral cancer. Consecutively, it is suggestive that periodontitis and oral cancer are distinct disease entities but share common pathogenic mechanisms. Oxidative stress and epigenetic mechanisms are among the most researched mechanisms responsible for initiating apoptotic mechanisms implicated in periodontitis and oral cancer. Current research aims to formulate therapeutic agents to intercede in these mechanisms via host modulation therapy and epigenetic therapy. These advances can revolutionize the treatment of periodontitis and oral cancer. This review aims to shed light on the common pathogenic mechanisms of these diseases and the various host modulation agents that could be beneficial in their treatment. © 2022","Epigenetics; Host modulation; Oral cancer; Oxidative stress; Periodontitis","Humans; Mouth Neoplasms; Periodontitis; antiinfective agent; antioxidant; I kappa B; mitogen activated protein kinase inhibitor; nitric oxide synthase inhibitor; omega 3 fatty acid; probiotic agent; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; apoptosis; epigenetics; host; human; modulation; mouth cancer; necrosis; nonhuman; oxidative stress; periodontitis; Review; mouth tumor","","","","","","","Elavarasu S., Sekar S., Murugan T., Host modulation by therapeutic agents, J Pharm Bioallied Sci, 4, pp. S256-S259, (2012); Hajishengallis G., Periodontitis: from microbial immune subversion to systemic inflammation, Nat Rev Immunol, 15, 1, pp. 30-44, (2015); Sulijaya B., Takahashi N., Yamazaki K., Host modulation therapy using anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents in periodontitis: a review to a clinical translation, Arch Oral Biol, 105, pp. 72-80, (2019); Chopra A., Sivaraman K., An update on possible pathogenic mechanisms of periodontal pathogens on renal dysfunction, Crit Rev Microbiol, 45, 5-6, pp. 514-538, (2019); Radaic A., Ganther S., Kamarajan P., Grandis J., Yom S.S., Kapila Y.L.; Soder B., Yakob M., Meurman J.H., Andersson L.C., Klinge B., Soder P.-O., Periodontal disease may associate with breast cancer, Breast Cancer Res Treat, 127, 2, pp. 497-502, (2011); Zhang L., Liu Y., Zheng H.J., Zhang C.P., The oral microbiota may have influence on oral cancer, Front Cell Infect Microbiol, 9, (2020); Hujoel P.P., Drangsholt M., Spiekerman C., Weiss N.S., An exploration of the periodontitis–cancer association, Ann Epidemiol, 13, 5, pp. 312-316, (2003); Shin J.M., Luo T., Kamarajan P., Fenno J.C., Rickard A.H., Kapila Y.L., Microbial communities associated with primary and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma–a high fusobacterial and low streptococcal signature, Sci Rep, 7, pp. 1-11, (2017); Malmgren R.A., Flanigan C.C., Localization of the vegetative form of Clostridium tetani in mouse tumors following intravenous spore administration, Cancer Res, 15, 7, pp. 473-478, (1955); Zhao M., Yang M., Li X.-M., Et al., Tumor-targeting bacterial therapy with amino acid auxotrophs of GFP-expressing Salmonella typhimurium, Proc Natl Acad Sci, 102, 3, pp. 755-760, (2005); Chang C., Geng F., Shi X., Et al., The prevalence rate of periodontal pathogens and its association with oral squamous cell carcinoma, Appl Microbiol Biotechnol, 103, 3, pp. 1393-1404, (2019); Kamarajan P., Ateia I., Shin J.M., Et al., Periodontal pathogens promote cancer aggressivity via TLR/MyD88 triggered activation of Integrin/FAK signaling that is therapeutically reversible by a probiotic bacteriocin, PLoS Pathog, 16, 10, (2020); Lucas H., Bartold P.M., Dharmapatni A., Holding C.A., Haynes D.R., Inhibition of apoptosis in periodontitis, J Dent Res, 89, 1, pp. 29-33, (2010); Gamonal J., Bascones A., Acevedo A., Blanco E., Silva A., Apoptosis in chronic adult periodontitis analyzed by in situ DNA breaks, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry, J Periodontol, 72, 4, pp. 517-525, (2001); Lane D.P., Lu X., Hupp T., Hall P.A., The role of the p53 protein in the apoptotic response, Role Apoptosis Dev Tissue Homeost Malig, pp. 41-44, (1995); Sionov R.V., Haupt Y., The cellular response to p53: the decision between life and death, Oncogene, 18, 45, pp. 6145-6157, (1999); Nagata S., Golstein P., The Fas death factor, Science (80-), 267, 5203, pp. 1449-1456, (1995); Sawa T., Nishimura F., Ohyama H., Takahashi K., Takashiba S., Murayama Y., In vitro induction of activation-induced cell death in lymphocytes from chronic periodontal lesions by exogenous Fas ligand, Infect Immun, 67, 3, pp. 1450-1454, (1999); Kim C.H., Gupta S., Expression of TRAIL (Apo2L), DR4 (TRAIL receptor 1), DR5 (TRAIL receptor 2) and TRID (TRAIL receptor 3) genes in multidrug resistant human acute myeloid leukemia cell lines that overexpress MDR 1 (HL60/Tax) or MRP (HL60/AR), Int J Oncol, 16, 6, pp. 1137-1146, (2000); Aggarwal B.B., Bhardwaj U., Takada Y., Regulation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by ectopic expression of antiapoptotic factors, Vitam Horm, 67, pp. 453-483, (2004); Cohen J.J., Programmed cell death in the immune system, Adv Immunol, 50, pp. 55-85, (1991); Wilson J.W., Potten C.S., Morphological recognition of apoptotic cells, Apoptosis A Pract Approach (ed G Studzinski), pp. 19-39, (1999); Ellis S.D., Tucci M.A., Serio F.G., Johnson R.B., Factors for progression of periodontal diseases, J oral Pathol Med, 27, 3, pp. 101-105, (1998); Kannan K., Jain S.K., Oxidative stress and apoptosis, Pathophysiology, 7, pp. 153-163, (2000); Kerr J.F.R., Winterford C.M., Harmon B.V., Apoptosis.

Using a 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, we assessed whether a genetic predisposition index for periodontal disease was associated with colorectal, lung, or pancreatic cancer risks. Methods: Our primary instrument included single nucleotide polymorphisms with strong genome-wide association study evidence for associations with chronic, aggressive, and/or severe periodontal disease (rs729876, rs1537415, rs2738058, rs12461706, rs16870060, rs2521634, rs3826782, and rs7762544). We used summary-level genetic data for colorectal cancer (n = 58 131 cases; Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium, Colon Cancer Family Registry, and Colorectal Transdisciplinary Study), lung cancer (n = 18 082 cases; International Lung Cancer Consortium), and pancreatic cancer (n = 9254 cases; Pancreatic Cancer Consortia). Four MR approaches were employed for this analysis: random-effects inverse-variance weighted (primary analyses), Mendelian Randomization-Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier, simple median, and weighted median. We conducted secondary analyses to determine if associations varied by cancer subtype (colorectal cancer location, lung cancer histology), sex (colorectal and pancreatic cancers), or smoking history (lung and pancreatic cancer). All statistical tests were 2-sided. Results: The genetic predisposition index for chronic or aggressive periodontitis was statistically significantly associated with a 3% increased risk of colorectal cancer (per unit increase in genetic index of periodontal disease; P =. 03), 3% increased risk of colon cancer (P =. 02), 4% increased risk of proximal colon cancer (P =. 01), and 3% increased risk of colorectal cancer among females (P =. 04); however, it was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of lung cancer or pancreatic cancer, overall or within most subgroups. Conclusions: Genetic predisposition to periodontitis may be associated with colorectal cancer risk.

We hypothesized that adults with severe PD will be less likely to report receipt of any type of oral cancer screening than adults with no PD. Materials and Methods: We used 2011-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data on adults ≥30 years. PD status was classified as no PD, mild/moderate PD and severe PD. Survey-adjusted logistic regression analysis was used to examine the model adjusted risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the outcome of not receiving intraoral, extraoral or both types of oral cancer screenings among adults with PD. Control variables included age, sex, race/ethnicity, health insurance, education, income level, smoking status, alcohol use and last dental visit. Results: The analytic sample included 6962 adults weighted to the national population of adults who had a periodontal examination during 2011-2014. Overall, 31.5%, 26.8% and 20.9% of adults reported receipt of intraoral, extraoral and both types of oral cancer screening, respectively. Almost 40% of adults had some form of PD (7.6% severe and 32.4% mild/moderate PD). A higher proportion of 45-64-year-olds, males, non-Hispanic Blacks, those with less than high school education, with income level less than 200% federal poverty level, or those with no insurance had severe PD than no PD. In adjusted analyses, adults with severe PD were significantly more likely to report no receipt of intraoral (RR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.12-1.40), extraoral (RR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.07-1.27) or both types of oral cancer screenings (RR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.10-1.27) than those with no PD. Conclusions: Significantly low proportion of adult's age ≥30 years with severe PD reported receiving any type of oral cancer screening. The association between PD and risk of oral cancers points to the need to improve oral cancer screening rates among adults with PD. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-three adult cancer patients who underwent panoramic radiography before cancer treatment and 1-2 years later were enrolled in this study. They received professional oral care, including oral hygiene instruction, scaling and root planing, professional mechanical tooth cleaning, and dental treatment or extraction of any tooth with the source of infection. Age, sex, smoking habit, probing pocket depth, alveolar bone loss, oral hygiene, number of teeth, leukocytes, haemoglobin, and albumin counts, cancer treatment, the administration of immunosuppressants, worsening of dental caries, and alveolar bone loss after 1-2 years were examined. Factors related to the worsening of dental caries and alveolar bone loss were analysed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Dental caries and periodontal disease worsened in 20.8% of the patients. Smoking habit and chemotherapy were independent risk factors for the worsening of dental caries, while alveolar bone loss greater than 1/3 and chemotherapy were independent risk factors related to worsening periodontal disease. CONCLUSION: Anticancer drug treatment is an exacerbating factor for dental caries and periodontal disease.","chemotherapy; periodontal disease; perioperative oral management; radiotherapy; risk factor","Adult; Child, Preschool; Dental Care; Dental Caries; Humans; Infant; Neoplasms; Oral Hygiene; Periodontal Diseases; Retrospective Studies; adult; dental caries; dental procedure; human; infant; mouth hygiene; neoplasm; periodontal disease; preschool child; retrospective study","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","17579996","","","34264046","English","Oral Health Prev Dent","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111727001"

Current evidence attributes such an association to the direct and indirect effects of virulence factors belonging to periodontal pathogens, to inflammatory mediators and to genetic factors. The aims of the study were to assess the existence of a genetic linkage between periodontitis and human CRC, to identify genes considered predominant in such a linkage, thus named leader genes, and to determine pathogenic mechanisms related to the products of leader genes. Genes linking periodontitis and CRC were identified and classified in order of predominance, through an experimental investigation, performed via computer simulation, employing the leader gene approach. Pathogenic mechanisms relating to leader genes were determined through cross-search databases. Of the 83 genes linking periodontitis and CRC, 12 were classified as leader genes and were pathogenically implicated in cell cycle regulation and in the immune-inflammatory response. The current results, obtained via computer simulation and requiring further validation, support the existence of a genetic linkage between periodontitis and CRC. Cell cycle dysregulation and the alteration of the immuno-inflammatory response constitute the pathogenic mechanisms related to the products of leader genes. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods Using claims data taken from the 1997-2013 Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), we identified 60,756 newly-diagnosed female breast cancer patients during the period 2003-2013 from all beneficiaries. We then randomly selected 243,024 women without breast cancer matching (1:4) for age and the year of the index date during 1997-2013 from a one million representative population acting as the control group. A conditional logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between periodontitis (ICD-9-CM codes 523.3-4) and the risk of breast cancer, shown as an odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) after adjustments for the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and level of urbanization. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on age, CCI and level of urbanization. Results The mean ± standard deviation age was 53 ± 14 years. After adjusting for potential confounders, the risk of female breast cancer was found to be associated with a history of periodontitis (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.10-1.14). Such an association was significantly different between patients aged < 65 years (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.06-1.11) and patients aged ≥ 65 years (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.18-1.28; p for interaction <0.001), as well as between patients where the CCI = 0 (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.15-1.20) and patients with CCI > 0 (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96-1.03; p for interaction <0.001). The highest level of urbanization was also associated with the risk of breast cancer. Conclusions This population-based nested case-control study demonstrated that periodontitis was significantly associated with the risk of female breast cancer and such an association was modified by both age and comorbidities.  © 2022 Chen et al.

Design Case-control study. Patient population Two hundred patients, regardless of periodontal and adverse habits (smoking and alcohol) status, in the age group of 18-90 years were included in this institutional study. One hundred patients with histologically confirmed oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) were included in the case group, while the control group had 100 patients without any oral cancer. Methods Multivariable examination to obtain socioeconomic and lifestyle risk factors was performed with a questionnaire for both the groups and compared statistically. Additionally, oral status (periodontal stage, clinical attachment loss, periodontal pocket depth, bleeding on probing, Silness-Loe plaque index, and decayed, missing, and filled teeth [DMFT] index) of both the groups was recorded and compared statistically. Results A significant correlation was found between age, gender and development of oral cancer. There was a significant co-relation between alcohol intake and oral cancer development. Surprisingly, there was no correlation between smoking habits and passive smoking with oral cancer development in the case group. Overall, 72.1% of case group patients had Stage 4 periodontitis, whereas 51.6% of control group patients had Stage 2 periodontitis. A significant correlation was found between the incidence of oral cancer and the stage of periodontitis. Conclusion The findings of the study support the hypothesis that periodontitis is an independent risk factor for oral cancer. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the British Dental Association.","","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Case-Control Studies; Humans; Middle Aged; Mouth Neoplasms; Periodontal Diseases; Periodontal Index; Risk Factors; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; aged; case control study; complication; human; middle aged; mouth tumor; periodontal disease; periodontal index; risk factor; squamous cell carcinoma; very elderly; young adult","","","","","","","Romandini M., Baima G., Antonoglou G., Bueno J., Figuero E., Sanz M., Periodontitis, Edentulism, and Risk of Mortality: A Systematic Review with Meta-analyses, J Dent Res, 100, pp. 37-49, (2021); Javed F., Warnakulasuriya S., Is there a relationship between periodontal disease and oral cancer?

Recently, increasing studies have explored the correlation of periodontal disease with the risk of prostate cancer. However, the findings were inconsistent. Hence, this study aims to investigate the association between periodontal disease and the risk of prostate cancer by a meta-analysis. Material and Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane were searched for publications up to July 17, 2020. Cohort and case-control studies evaluating the risk of prostate cancer in patients with periodontal disease were included. A fixed or random-effect model was used to calculate the summary relative risk (RR) along with 95% confidence interval (CI). All analyses were conducted using Stata 12.0 software. Results: Seven studies were included in the final analysis. The pooled estimates showed that periodontal disease was significantly associated with the risk of prostate cancer (RR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.07-1.27; P = 0.001). Findings of sensitivity analyses proved that the overall results were robust. Conclusions: Periodontal disease may be considered as a potential risk factor for prostate cancer. Although it’s a possibility, males should be more aware of their oral health and implement effective measures to prevent and treat periodontal disease. © Medicina Oral S. L.

We assessed the relationship between periodontal disease and breast cancer in a large prospective cohort study. The Sister Study followed women without prior breast cancer ages 35 to 74 years from 2003 to 2017 (N ¼ 49,968). Baseline periodontal disease was self-reported, and incident breast cancer was ascertained over a mean follow-up of 9.3 years. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for multiple potential confounders, including smoking status. Heterogeneity in risk for invasive breast cancer versus DCIS was also estimated. About 22% of participants reported a history of periodontal disease at baseline. A total of 3,339 incident breast cancers (2,607 invasive breast cancer, 732 DCIS) were identified. There was no clear association between periodontal disease and overall breast cancer risk (HR ¼ 1.02; 95% CI, 0.94–1.11). However, we observed a nonstatistically significant suggestive increased risk of invasive breast cancer (HR ¼ 1.07; 95% CI, 0.97–1.17) and decreased risk of DCIS (HR ¼ 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72–1.04) associated with periodontal disease, with evidence for heterogeneity in the risk associations (relative HR for invasive breast cancer versus DCIS ¼ 1.24; 95% CI, 1.01–1.52). A case-only analysis for etiologic heterogeneity confirmed this difference. We observed no clear association between periodontal disease and overall breast cancer risk. The heterogeneity in risk associations for invasive breast cancer versus DCIS warrants further exploration. © 2020 American Association for Cancer Research.","","Adult; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast; Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Middle Aged; Periodontal Diseases; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; United States; adult; aged; breast cancer; cancer risk; cohort analysis; dentist; disease association; ex-smoker; female; follow up; human; intraductal carcinoma; invasive breast cancer; major clinical study; mammography; periodontal disease; postmenopause; premenopause; prospective study; Review; smoking; breast tumor; incidence; intraductal carcinoma; middle aged; Paget nipple disease; pathology; pathophysiology; periodontal disease; prognosis; risk factor; United States","","","","","CIFMS, (R-03); Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Cancer Institute, NCI, (ZIA CP010126-17); National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, (Z01-ES044005, ZIAES102245)","This work was supported in part by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH, NCI (project ZIA CP010126-17 to G.L.

A higher risk of head and neck cancer has been consistently associated with periodontitis. This relationship has been explained by the local promotion of dysbiosis, chronic inflammation, immune evasion, and direct (epi)genetic damage to epithelial cells by periodontal pathobionts and their toxins. Epidemiological reports have also studied a possible link between periodontitis and the incidence of other malignancies at distant sites, such as lung, breast, prostate, and digestive tract cancers. Mechanistically, different pathways have been involved, including the induction of a chronic systemic inflammatory state and the spreading of oral pathobionts with carcinogenic potential. Indeed, periodontitis may promote low-grade systemic inflammation and phenotypic changes in the mononuclear cells, leading to the release of free radicals and cytokines, as well as extracellular matrix degradation, which are all mechanisms involved in carcinogenic and metastatic processes. Moreover, the transient hematogenous spill out or micro-aspiration/swallowing of periodontal bacteria and their virulence factors (i.e., lipopolysaccharides, fimbriae), may lead to non-indigenous bacterial colonization of multiple microenvironments. These events may in turn replenish the tumor-associated microbiome and thus influence the molecular hallmarks of cancer. Particularly, specific strains of oral pathobionts (e.g., Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) may translocate through the hematogenous and enteral routes, being implicated in esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, and colorectal tumorigenesis through the modulation of the gastrointestinal antitumor immune system (i.e., tumor-infiltrating T cells) and the increased expression of pro-inflammatory/oncogenic genes. Ultimately, the potential influence of common risk factors, relevant comorbidities, and upstream drivers, such as gerovulnerability to multiple diseases, in explaining the relationship cannot be disregarded. The evidence analyzed here emphasizes the possible relevance of periodontitis in cancer initiation/progression and stimulates future research endeavors. © 2023 The Authors.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of periodontal disease with risk of bladder cancer by a meta-analysis. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched for eligible publications up to December 15, 2017. Cohort and nested case-control studies on the association between periodontal disease and risk of bladder cancer were included. After study selection and data extraction, pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated using a fixed-effect inverse-variance model. All analyses were performed using the RevMan 5.3 software. Results: Finally, five cohort studies were identified and included in this meta-analysis, involving 1,104 bladder cancer cases of 298,476 participants. Summary estimates based on adjusted data showed that periodontal disease was not significantly associated with the risk of bladder cancer (HR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.95-1.25, I2 = 0%). A similar result was also observed after cumulative, subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Current evidence from cohort studies suggests that patients with periodontal disease may not be at an increased risk of developing bladder cancer. © 2018 Xie, Jin, Leng, Wang, Zeng and the BPSC investigators.","Cohort studies; Meta-analysis; Periodontal diseases; Periodontitis; Urinary bladder neoplasms","bladder cancer; cancer risk; disease association; human; periodontal disease; Review; sensitivity analysis; software","","","","","","","Ansai T., Takata Y., Yoshida A., Soh I., Awano S., Hamasaki T., Et al., Association between tooth loss and orodigestive cancer mortality in an 80-year-old community-dwelling Japanese population: a 12-year prospective study, BMC Public Health, 13, (2013); Arora M., Weuve J., Fall K., Pedersen N.L., Mucci L.A., An exploration of shared genetic risk factors between periodontal disease and cancers: a prospective co-twin study, Am.

These findings are generally consistent among cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. In this paper, we review epidemiologic studies and current knowledge on periodontal disease and cancer, with a focus on those studies conducted in the years following the Joint European Federation of Periodontology/American Academy of Periodontology Workshop on “Periodontitis and Systemic Diseases” in November 2012. This review also explores the role of chronic inflammation as a biologically plausible mechanistic link between periodontal disease and risk of cancer. Furthermore, it highlights studies that have examined the potential importance of certain periodontal pathogens in this association. © 2020 The Authors.

Methods: Data mining, metabolomic pathways analysis, study of metabolite–gene networks related to these diseases. Machine-learning and deep-learning methods for development of the model for recognition of oral cancer versus periodontitis, using patients' saliva. Results: The most accurate classifications between oral cancer and periodontitis were performed using neural networks, logistic regression and stochastic gradient descent confirmed by the separate 10-fold cross-validations. The best results were achieved by the deep-learning neural network with the TensorFlow program. Accuracy of the resulting model was 79.54%. The other methods, which did not rely on deep learning, were able to achieve comparable, although slightly worse results with respect to accuracy. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a possibility to distinguish oral cancer from periodontal disease by analysis the saliva metabolites of a patient, using machine-learning methods. These findings may be useful in the development of a non-invasive method to aid care providers in determining between oral cancer and periodontitis quickly and effectively. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The early diagnosis of oral diseases allows the efficient therapy of the patient. During oral diseases, resident cells in the affected tissue secrete exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) into saliva. As these miRNAs have a crucial role in the pathogenesis of oral diseases, they have been suggested as non-invasive and validated biomarkers in predicting periodontitis severity and cancer progression. Several attempts have been performed to evaluate the expression of salivary exosomal miRNAs in patients with periodontitis and oral cancers. Some miRNAs are differentially expressed in the saliva of the affected patients when compared to healthy individuals. These miRNAs are reviewed in this narrative review. Collectively, it seems that salivary exosomal microRNAs could be used as a diagnostic biomarker in oral diseases. However, further studies are required to validate them. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","biomarker; exosome; microRNA; oral cancers; periodontal disease; saliva","Biomarkers; Humans; MicroRNAs; Mouth Neoplasms;

Oral cancer, as well as acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, may influence the methylation level of several genes in the oral cavity. In the present study, we evaluated the presence of periodontal disease (PD) and the methylation status using our 13-gene panel. Methods: Oral brushing specimens were collected from three different patient groups: 23 gingival OSCC patients, 15 patients affected by PD, and 15 healthy volunteers lacking evidence of PD. DNA methylation analysis was performed and each sample was determined to be positive or negative based on a predefined cut-off value. Results: Positive results were found for 23/23 OSCC patients, 3/15 PD patients, and 0/15 samples from healthy volunteers. The GP1BB and MIR193 genes in the PD group exhibited mean methylation levels similar to OSCC patients. ZAP70 showed different methylation levels among three groups. Conclusion: Preliminary data identified shared epigenetic alterations between PD and OSCC patients in two inflammatory genes (GP1BB and MIR193). This study may help to identify potential links between the two diseases and serve as a starting point for the future research focused on pathogenesis. © 2022 The Authors.

These two factors are likely to share common biologic mechanisms such as inflammation and dysbiosis. We examined the joint association of peptic ulcer (gastric/duodenal) and periodontal disease on bladder cancer risk. Methods: We conducted a prospective analysis among 45,185 men (563 invasive bladder cancer cases) in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (follow-up 1986–2016). History of ulcer and periodontal disease was self-reported at baseline and updated during the follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the joint associations of ulcers (gastric, duodenal) and periodontal disease, adjusting for age and other potential confounders. We tested for interaction using the Wald test for product terms. Results: Compared with men having no history of ulcer and periodontal disease, men with a history of peptic ulcer only (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.90–1.66) and men with a history of periodontal disease only (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.98–1.46) were associated with higher risk of invasive bladder cancer. The highest bladder cancer risk was observed in men with a history of both peptic ulcer and periodontal disease (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.05–2.20). Similar results were found when we stratified by ulcer types. The interactions between ulcer and periodontal disease were not statistically significant for all ulcer types (p-interaction ≥ 0.59). Conclusion: We did not find sufficient evidence for interaction between gastric/duodenal ulcers and periodontal disease on bladder cancer risk. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bladder cancer; Duodenum; Gastric; Oral health; Periodontal; Ulcer","Aged; Duodenal Ulcer; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Peptic Ulcer; Periodontal Diseases; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk; United States; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms; adult; aged; Article; bladder cancer; cancer risk; controlled study; duodenum ulcer; follow up; gastrointestinal endoscopy; health practitioner; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nutritional assessment; peptic ulcer; periodontal disease; physical activity; priority journal; prospective study; questionnaire; risk assessment; risk factor; self report; stomach cancer; bladder tumor; duodenum ulcer; peptic ulcer; periodontal disease; proportional hazards model; risk; United States","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01 HL35464, UM1 CA167552); Korea University, KU, (K1808781); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (NRF-2018R1A4A1022589, NRF-2018R1C1B6008822)"," This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (R01 HL35464 and UM1 CA167552).

The above-mentioned genetic markers were assessed in patients with pancreatic cancer (n = 18) and chronic pancreatitis (n = 39) as well as in a healthy control group (n = 115). The established inclusion criteria were the following: Caucasian descent, non-smoking, and age range 20–80, with different levels of periodontitis activity according to S. Offenbacher’s scale. The genotyping reactions were performed by means of an RT-PCR with the use of TaqMan® genotyping assay. Results of the study revealed that the state of periodontium was significantly worse in patients with chronic pancreatitis. The Q705K and F359L polymorphisms were associated with more advanced cases of periodontitis measured by clinical attachment level, whereas the Q705K was associated with intensified bleeding index. Furthermore, the F359L single-nucleotide polymorphism was significantly higher in the group with chronic pancreatitis (p < 0.0001; OR = 6.8571). Whereas, the prevalence of Q705K polymorphism was higher in the group of pancreatic cancer (p = 0.107; OR = 3.3939). This study suggests that the exaggerated inflammatory response provoked by Q705K and F359L might be the common denominator for periodontitis, pancreatic cancer, and chronic pancreatitis. These findings might constitute the basis for a new diagnostic and therapeutic approach. © 2015, The Author(s).","Chronic pancreatitis; Inflammasomes; Inflammation mediators; Innate immunity; Pancreatic cancer; Periodontitis","Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Adult; Aged; Carrier Proteins; Chronic Disease; Cytokines; Female; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Male; Middle Aged; NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Pancreatitis; Periodontitis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Signal Transduction; inflammasome; nucleotide binding oligomerization domain like receptor; autacoid; carrier protein; cryopyrin; cytokine; NLRP2 protein, human; NLRP3 protein, human; signal transducing adaptor protein; adult; aged; Article; cancer patient; Caucasian; chronic pancreatitis; clinical article; controlled study; correlational study; disease severity; DNA polymorphism; female; genetic marker; genotype; human; intervention study; male; pancreas cancer; periodontitis; periodontium; prevalence; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; single nucleotide polymorphism; smoking; chronic disease; genetic association study; genetic predisposition; genetics; immunology; metabolism; middle aged; pancreas tumor; pancreatitis; periodontitis; single nucleotide polymorphism","","carrier protein, 80700-39-6; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing, ; Carrier Proteins, ; Cytokines, ; Inflammation Mediators, ; NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein, ; NLRP2 protein, human, ; NLRP3 protein, human, ","","","","","Belibasakis G.N., Johansson A., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans targets NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasome expression in human mononuclear leukocytes, Cytokine, 59, pp. 124-130, (2012); Camen G.C., Caraivan O., Olteanu M., Et al., Inflammatory reaction in chronic periodontopathies in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Inadequate control of confounders, including life course exposures, may have influenced prior findings. We estimate the extent to which high levels of periodontal diseases, measured by gingival inflammation and recession, are associated with oral cancer risk using a comprehensive subset of potential confounders and applying a stringent adjustment approach. In a hospital-based case-control study, incident oral cancer cases (N = 350) were recruited from two major referral hospitals in Kerala, South India, from 2008 to 2012. Controls (N = 371), frequency-matched by age and sex, were recruited from clinics at the same hospitals. Structured interviews collected information on several domains of exposure via a detailed life course questionnaire. Periodontal diseases, as measured by gingival inflammation and gingival recession, were evaluated visually by qualified dentists following a detailed protocol. The relationship between periodontal diseases and oral cancer risk was assessed by unconditional logistic regression using a stringent empirical selection of potential confounders corresponding to a 1% change-in-estimates. Generalized gingival recession was significantly associated with oral cancer risk (Odds Ratio = 1.83, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.10–3.04). No significant association was observed between gingival inflammation and oral cancer. Our findings support the hypothesis that high levels of periodontal diseases increase the risk of oral cancer. © 2016 UICC","case-control study; gingivitis; India; mouth neoplasms; oral cancer; oral health; periodontal diseases; periodontitis","adult; alcohol consumption; Article; cancer incidence; cancer localization; cancer risk; case control study; controlled study; disease association; educational status; feeding behavior; female; gingivitis; human; India; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mouth cancer; mouth examination; multicenter study; periodontal disease; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk assessment; sex ratio; smoking; structured interview","","","","","Canada Research Chair","We would like to thank our collaborators at the Indian site and the HeNCe Life study team.

Materials and Methods : In this cross sectional study a self administered questionnaire was used for data collection. A total of 184 school teachers were selected for the study. A response rate of 96.7% (n = 178) was obtained. Results : Of the respondents, 36.5% (n = 65) had poor knowledge, while 27.5% had good knowledge regarding the prevention of oral cancer and gum disease. School teachers with postgraduate qualification were better informed with regard to the prevention of oral diseases as compared to those with only a bachelor degree. Factors such as education, sex, and type of institutional funding (public/private) were significantly correlated with the level of knowledge (R2 = 0.1128; P < 0.05). Conclusion : School teachers need to be motivated to improve their awareness and knowledge about the prevention of oral cancer and gum diseases, particularly the younger teachers and those with only bachelor degrees.

Methods: This was a hospital-based study, which included 67 cases and 134 controls (1:2). Women were selected consecutively between April, 2013 and June, 2015 among those attending the Department of Gynecology at the University Hospital of Santa Maria. Cases were selected among women diagnosed with breast cancer (ICD-10 C50), and controls were matched for age (±2 years), and smoking status (never, former and current smoker). Conditional logistic regression was used to model the association between periodontitis and breast cancer with and without adjustment for potential confounders. Four case definitions for periodontitis were used. Results: Cases had significantly greater clinical attachment loss than controls (P=.04). After adjusting for important covariates, women diagnosed with periodontitis had two to three times higher odds of breast cancer than women without periodontitis depending on the case definition of periodontitis (P<.05). Conclusions: A significant association was observed between periodontitis and breast cancer. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The metabolic profile of saliva can provide an early outlook of the changes associated with a wide range of diseases, including oral cancer and periodontal diseases. It is possible to measure levels of disease-specific metabolites using different methods as presented in this study. However, many challenges exist including incomplete understanding of the complicated metabolic pathways of different oral diseases. The review concludes with the discussion on future perspectives of salivary metabolomics from a clinician point of view. Salivary metabolomics may afford a new research avenue to identify local and systemic disorders but also to aid in the design and modification of therapies.

Data on periodontal disease were obtained at baseline and every other year thereafter in a cohort of 51 529 male health professionals aged 40-75 years. A total of 216 patients were diagnosed with incident pancreatic cancer during 16 years of follow-up. Multivariable relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models controlling for potential confounders, including detailed smoking history. All statistical tests were two-sided. Compared with no periodontal disease, history of periodontal disease was associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk (overall, multivariable RR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.19 to 2.26; P =.002; crude incidence rates: 61 versus 25 per 100 000 person-years; among never smokers, multivariable RR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.18 to 3.71; P =.01; crude incidence rates: 61 versus 19 per 100 000 person-years). In contrast, baseline number of natural teeth and cumulative tooth loss during follow-up were not strongly associated with pancreatic cancer. The association between periodontal disease and increased risk of pancreatic cancer may occur through plausible biologic mechanisms, but confirmation of this association is necessary. © The Author 2007.","","Adult; Aged; Follow-Up Studies; Health Personnel; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Periodontal Diseases; Periodontitis; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Tooth Loss; United States; adult; aged; article; cancer risk; disease association; follow up; health practitioner; human; major clinical study; male; pancreas cancer; periodontal disease; periodontitis; priority journal; prospective study; questionnaire; smoking; United States; health care personnel; hospitalization; incidence; middle aged; pancreas tumor; periodontal disease; periodontitis; risk assessment; risk factor; statistics; United States","","","","","National Cancer Institute, NCI, (R01CA095589, R01CA124908)","","Cancer facts & figures 2006, (2006); Everhart J., Wright D., Diabetes mellitus as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer.

Methods: We searched the electronic databases of PubMed and Wanfang to include the articles related to periodontal disease and oral cancer risk. The association between periodontal disease and oral cancer risk was assessed by odds ratio (OR) and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The publication bias was evaluated by Begg's funnel plot and Egger's line regression test. All the data analysis was done by STATA12.0 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). Results: Eleven case-control studies were included in our present meta-Analysis. We found significant statistical heterogeneity was existed in our present meta-Analysis (I2 = 99.8%, P < 0.05). Hence, the data were pooled by random effect model. The pooled results indicated a significant correlation between periodontal disease and oral cancer risk was found with OR = 3.21 and the 95% CI = 2.25-4.16 (P < 0.05). The Begg's funnel plot was obvious asymmetric indicating significant publication bias. Moreover, further Egger's line regression test also indicated significant publications (t = 3.35, P < 0.05). Conclusion: Our present meta-Analysis indicated that periodontal disease can increase the oral cancer risk by nearly 2-fold. © 2017 Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Meta-Analysis; oral cancer; periodontal disease","Case-Control Studies; Cohort Studies; Disease Susceptibility; Humans; Mouth Neoplasms; Odds Ratio; Periodontal Diseases; Publication Bias; Risk; Article; cancer risk; case control study; human; mouth cancer; periodontal disease; systematic review; cohort analysis; complication; disease predisposition; meta analysis; Mouth Neoplasms; odds ratio; Periodontal Diseases; publishing; risk","","","","","","","Santosh A.B., Jones T., Harvey J., A review on oral cancer biomarkers: Understanding the past and learning from the present, J Cancer Res Ther, 12, pp. 486-492, (2016); Kumar M., Nanavati R., Modi T.G., Dobariya C., Oral cancer: Etiology and risk factors: A review, J Cancer Res Ther, 12, pp. 458-463, (2016); Patel J.B., Shah F.D., Joshi G.M., Patel P.S., Clinical significance of inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of oral cancer, J Cancer Res Ther, 12, pp. 447-457, (2016); Marshall J.R., Graham S., Haughey B.P., Shedd D., Oshea R., Brasure J., Et al., Smoking, alcohol, dentition and diet in the epidemiology of oral cancer, Eur J Cancer B Oral Oncol, 28, pp. 9-15, (1992); Talamini R., Vaccarella S., Barbone F., Tavani A., La Vecchia C., Herrero R., Et al., Oral hygiene, dentition, sexual habits and risk of oral cancer, Br J Cancer, 83, pp. 1238-1242, (2000); Guha N., Boffetta P., Wonsch Filho V., Eluf Neto J., Shangina O., Zaridze D., Et al., Oral health and risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and esophagus: Results of two multicentric case-control studies, Am J Epidemiol, 166, pp. 1159-1173, (2007); Zheng T.Z., Boyle P., Hu H.F., Duan J., Jian P.J., Ma D.Q., Et al., Dentition, oral hygiene, and risk of oral cancer: A case-control study in Beijing, Peoples Republic of China, Cancer Causes Control, 1, pp. 235-241, (1990); Bundgaard T., Wildt J., Frydenberg M., Elbrond O., Nielsen J.E., Case-control study of squamous cell cancer of the oral cavity in Denmark, Cancer Causes Control, 6, pp. 57-67, (1995); Garrote L.F., Herrero R., Reyes R.M., Vaccarella S., Anta J.L., Ferbeye L., Et al., Risk factors for cancer of the oral cavity and oro-pharynx in Cuba, Br J Cancer, 85, pp. 46-54, (2001); Rosenquist K., Wennerberg J., Schildt E.B., Bladstrom A., Goran Hansson B., Andersson G., Oral status, oral infections and some lifestyle factors as risk factors for oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma A population-based case-control study in southern Sweden, Acta Otolaryngol, 125, pp. 1327-1336, (2005); Tezal M., Sullivan M.A., Reid M.E., Marshall J.R., Hyland A., Loree T., Et al., Chronic periodontitis and the risk of tongue cancer, Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, 133, pp. 450-454, (2007); Tezal M., Sullivan M.A., Hyland A., Marshall J.R., Stoler D., Reid M.E., Et al., Chronic periodontitis and the incidence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev, 18, pp. 2406-2412, (2009); Divaris K., Olshan A.F., Smith J., Bell M.E., Weissler M.C., Funkhouser W.K., Et al., Oral health and risk for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: The Carolina Head and Neck Cancer Study, Cancer Causes Control, 21, pp. 567-575, (2010); Ansai T., Takata Y., Yoshida A., Soh I., Awano S., Hamasaki T., Et al., Association between tooth loss and orodigestive cancer mortality in an 80-year-old community-dwelling Japanese population: A 12-year prospective study, BMC Public Health, 13, (2013); Ebersole J.L., Graves C.L., Gonzalez O.A., Dawson D., Morford L.A., Huja P.E., Et al., Aging, inflammation, immunity and periodontal disease, Periodontol 2000, 72, pp. 54-75, (2016); Chatzopoulos G., Smoking, smokeless tobacco, and alcohol consumption as contributing factors to periodontal disease, Northwest Dent, 95, pp. 37-41, (2016); Buglione M., Cavagnini R., Di Rosario F., Maddalo M., Vassalli L., Grisanti S., Et al., Oral toxicity management in head and neck cancer patients treated with chemotherapy and radiation: Xerostomia and trismus (Part 2) Literature review and consensus statement, Crit Rev Oncol Hematol, 102, pp. 47-54, (2016); Sultana J., Bashar A., Molla M.R., New management strategies of oral tongue cancer in Bangladesh, J Maxillofac Oral Surg, 13, pp. 394-400, (2014)","L.

Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between ACH and incident cancer outcomes were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: There were 203 confirmed total incident cancer cases during follow-up (12.2 ± 4.2 years). After adjusting for age and smoking, there were no statistically significant associations between ACH-defined PD categories and total cancer risk (mild/moderate vs. none: HR 1.33, 95 % CI 0.91–1.94; severe vs. none: HR 1.20, 95 % CI 0.77–1.86). ACH-defined PD categories were not associated with common site-specific cancers. Whole-mouth mean and worst-site ACH (per 1 mm loss) were significantly associated with increased risk of lung (adjusted HR 1.81, 95 % CI 1.30–2.54; adjusted HR 1.34, 95 % CI 1.08–1.66, respectively), but not total or other site-specific cancer. Smoking status modified the associations between continuous ACH variables and total cancer risk; measures of PD were associated with total cancer among smokers but not never smokers (interaction p = 0.02 and p < 0.01 for whole-mouth mean and worst-site ACH, respectively). Conclusions: ACH-defined PD was associated with total cancer risk in ever but not never smoking postmenopausal women. Whole-mouth mean and worst-site ACH were associated with increased lung cancer risk. However, these results need to be interpreted cautiously given the small number of lung cancer cases (n = 18). Further research utilizing a larger sample is warranted to confirm the relationships among oral bone loss, site-specific cancers, and total cancer. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Alveolar bone loss; Cancer epidemiology; Inflammation; Periodontal disease; Postmenopausal women; Prospective studies","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Breast Neoplasms; Chronic Periodontitis; Colorectal Neoplasms; Endometrial Neoplasms; Female; Hematologic Neoplasms; Humans; Incidence; Lung Neoplasms; Melanoma; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; New York; Periodontal Diseases; Postmenopause; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Smoking; adult; age; aged; alveolar crestal height; Article; breast cancer; cancer incidence; cancer risk; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; endometrium cancer; female; follow up; hematologic malignancy; human; lung cancer; major clinical study; melanoma; periodontal disease; periodontics; postmenopause; priority journal; smoking; Breast Neoplasms; chronic periodontitis; Colorectal Neoplasms; Endometrial Neoplasms; Hematologic Neoplasms; incidence; Lung Neoplasms; melanoma; middle aged; Neoplasms; New York; Periodontal Diseases; proportional hazards model; prospective study; risk factor; severity of illness index; very elderly","","","","","Interdisciplinary Training in Cancer Epidemiology; National Institutes of Health, NIH; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, (HHSN268201100002C, HHSN268201100003C, HHSN268201100004C, HHSN268201100046C, HHSN271201100004C); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI, (HHSN268201100001C, N01WH32122); National Cancer Institute, NCI, (R25CA113951); National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR, (R01DE013505); U.S. Army, (OS950077)","This study was supported by Grant R01DE013505 from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Md., to Dr. Wactawski-Wende, U.S. Army, Medical Research and Materiel Command, Fort Detrick, Md., Grant OS950077 and NIH/National Heart Lung and Blood Institute contracts N01WH32122 and HHSN268201100001C (Women’s Health Initiative) to Dr. Wactawski-Wende.

The purpose of this paper is to review the literature to explore the evidence to date of a relationship between periodontal disease and cancer. In addition, the main hypotheses for the association are discussed along with challenges in evaluating the evidence. Data/sources/study selection: In this review, English-language papers studying the relationship between periodontal disease or tooth loss in humans and increased risk of several types of cancers along with overall cancer risk between 1990 and April 2009 were reviewed. Conclusions: The most consistent increased risk was noted in studies of oral and esophageal cancers and periodontal disease. Gastric and pancreatic cancers had an association in most but not all studies. Lung, prostate, hematologic and other cancers were less consistently associated or did not have sufficient studies to determine a predictable pattern. Studies to date indicate a positive correlation between several forms of cancer and periodontal disease. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal of this study was to explore the periodontitis-cancer association in the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study. METHODS: Data were available on 11,328 adults, age 25 to 74 years, who were diagnosed as dentate individuals with either periodontitis (n = 2092), gingivitis (n = 2603), a healthy periodontium (n = 2,671), or as individuals without teeth (edentulous n = 3,962) at the beginning of the follow-up. The main outcome measure was fatal cancer, as ascertained from death certificates. RESULTS: Compared with individuals with a healthy periodontium, fatal cancer occurrence was positively associated with periodontitis at baseline (age and gender adjusted odds ratio = 1.55, 95% confidence interval: 1.25-1.92). Of the different cancer types, lung cancer demonstrated the strongest association. After adjustment for known risk factors for lung cancer, the magnitude of the association between periodontitis and lung cancer ranged between 1.48 (95% confidence interval: 0.88-2.50) and 1.73 (95% confidence interval: 1.01-2.97). CONCLUSIONS: Associations between periodontitis and lung cancer mortality can be identified above and beyond adjustment for known risk factors for lung cancer. Despite these apparent unconfounded associations, there are reasons to believe that the periodontitis-cancer associations may be spurious. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Recent evidence has suggested periodontal disease might be associated with lung cancer. However, their precise relationship is yet to be explored. Hence, this study aims to investigate the association of periodontal disease and risk of incident lung cancer using a meta-analytic approach. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect were searched up to June 10, 2015. Cohort and nested case-control studies investigating risk of lung cancer in patients with periodontal disease were included. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated, as were their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a fixed-effect inverse-variance model. Statistical heterogeneity was explored using the Q test as well as the I2 statistic. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots symmetry and Egger's test. Results: Five cohort studies were included, involving 321,420 participants in this meta-analysis. Summary estimates based on adjusted data showed that periodontal disease was associated with a significant risk of lung cancer (HR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.13 to 1.36; I2 = 30%). No publication bias was detected. Subgroup analysis indicated that the association of periodontal disease and lung cancer remained significant in the female population. Conclusion: Evidence from cohort studies suggests that patients with periodontal disease are at increased risk of developing lung cancer.","Cohort studies; Evidence-based medicine; Lung neoplasms; Meta-analysis;

Few studies have examined the association between periodontal disease and cancer. Patients and methods: A total of 19 933 men reported being never smokers (of cigarette, pipes or cigars) in the Health Professionals' Follow-up Study. Periodontal disease status and teeth number were self-reported at baseline and during follow-up. All cancers were ascertained during 26 years of follow-up. Cox's proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) adjusting for risk factors. Results: A 13% increase in total cancer was observed among men reporting periodontitis at baseline, and a 45% increase in risk was observed among men with advanced periodontitis ( periodontitis with < 17 remaining teeth). Periodontitis was not associated with prostate cancer, colorectal cancer or melanoma, the three most common cancers in this cohort of never smokers, but a 33% increase in risk was observed for smoking-related cancers (lung, bladder, oropharnygeal, esophageal, kidney, stomach and liver cancers; HR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.07-1.65). Men with advanced periodontitis had an HR of 2.57 (95% CI 1.56-4.21; P = 0.0002) for smoking-related cancers, compared with men who did not have periodontitis and had 17 teeth or more. Advanced periodontitis was associated with elevated risks of esophageal and head and neck cancers (HR = 6.29, 95% CI 2.13-18.6; based on five cases with advanced periodontitis) and bladder cancer (HR = 5.06, 95% CI 2.32-11.0; based on nine cases with advanced periodontitis). Conclusions: Advanced periodontitis was associated with a 2.5-fold increase in smoking-related cancers among never smokers. Periodontitis may impact cancer risk through system immune dysregulation. Further studies need to examine the immune impact of advanced periodontitis on cancer, especially for cancers known to be caused by smoking. © The Author 2016.","Cancer risk; Never smokers; Periodontal disease","Adult; Aged; Colorectal Neoplasms; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Melanoma; Middle Aged; Periodontal Diseases; Proportional Hazards Models; Prostatic Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Smokers; Smoking; adult; Article; bladder cancer; cancer risk; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; confidence interval; disease association; esophagus cancer; follow up; hazard ratio; head and neck cancer; health practitioner; human; immunopathology; kidney cancer; liver cancer; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; medical research; melanoma; oropharynx cancer; periodontal disease; priority journal; proportional hazards model; prospective study; prostate cancer; risk assessment; risk factor; self report; smoking; stomach cancer; aged; colorectal tumor; complication; health care personnel; melanoma; middle aged; pathology; periodontal disease; prostate tumor; smoking","","","","","National Cancer Institute, NCI, (R01CA166150, UM1CA167552)","","Hajishengallis G., Periodontitis: from microbial immune subversion to systemic inflammation, Nat Rev Immunol, 15, pp. 30-44, (2015); Fodor A., Utilizing 'omics' tools to study the complex gut ecosystem, Adv Exp Med Biol, 817, pp. 25-38, (2014); Saggioro A., Leaky gut, microbiota, and cancer: an incoming hypothesis, J Clin Gastroenterol, 48, pp. S62-S66, (2014); McAllister F., Housseau F., Sears C.L., Microbiota and immune responses in colon cancer: more to learn, Cancer J, 20, pp. 232-236, (2014); Hajishengallis G., Lamont R.J., Beyond the red complex and into more complexity: the polymicrobial synergy and dysbiosis (PSD) model of periodontal disease etiology, Mol Oral Microbiol, 27, pp. 409-419, (2012); Hajishengallis G., Sahingur S.E., Novel inflammatory pathways in periodontitis, Adv Dent Res, 26, pp. 23-29, (2014); Michaud D.S., Liu Y., Meyer M., Et al., Periodontal disease, tooth loss, and cancer risk in male health professionals: a prospective cohort study, Lancet Oncol, 9, pp. 550-558, (2008); Hujoel P.P., Drangsholt M., Spiekerman C., Weiss N.S., An exploration of the periodontitis-cancer association, Ann Epidemiol, 13, pp. 312-316, (2003); Ahn J., Segers S., Hayes R.B., Periodontal disease, Porphyromonas gingivalis serum antibody levels and orodigestive cancer mortality, Carcinogenesis, 33, pp. 1055-1058, (2012); Mai X., LaMonte M.J., Hovey K.M., Et al., History of periodontal disease diagnosis and lung cancer incidence in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, Cancer Causes Control, 25, pp. 1045-1053, (2014); Michaud D.S., Izard J., Wilhelm-Benartzi C.S., Et al., Plasma antibodies to oral bacteria and risk of pancreatic cancer in a large European prospective cohort study, Gut, 62, pp. 1764-1770, (2013); Eliot M.N., Michaud D.S., Langevin S.M., Et al., Periodontal disease and mouthwash use are risk factors for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, Cancer Causes Control, 24, pp. 1315-1322, (2013); Meyer M.S., Joshipura K., Giovannucci E., Michaud D.S., A review of the relationship between tooth loss, periodontal disease, and cancer, Cancer Causes Control, 19, pp. 895-907, (2008); Joshipura K.J., Douglass C.W., Garcia R.I., Et al., Validity of a self-reported periodontal disease measure, J Public Health Dent, 56, pp. 205-212, (1996); Joshipura K.J., Pitiphat W., Douglass C.W., Validation of self-reported periodontal measures among health professionals, J Public Health Dent, 62, pp. 115-121, (2002); Douglass C.W., Berlin J., Tennstedt S., The validity of self-reported oral health status in the elderly, J Public Health Dent, 51, pp. 220-222, (1991); Vineis P., Alavanja M., Buffler P., Et al., Tobacco and cancer: recent epidemiological evidence, J Natl Cancer Inst, 96, pp. 99-106, (2004); Lockhart P.B., Bolger A.F., Papapanou P.N., Et al., Periodontal disease and atherosclerotic vascular disease: does the evidence support an independent association?, A scientific statement from the American Heart Association.

Periodontitis is associated with a local overly aggressive immune response and a spectrum of systemic effects, but the role of this condition in orodigestive cancers is unclear. We prospectively examined clinically ascertained periodontitis (N = 12 605) and serum IgG immune response to P. gingivalis (N = 7852) in relation to orodigestive cancer mortality among men and women in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III. A detailed oral health exam was conducted from 1988 to 1994 in survey Phases I and II, whereas serum IgG for P. gingivalis was measured from 1991 to 1994 in Phase II only. One hundred and five orodigestive cancer deaths were ascertained through 31 December 2006. Periodontitis (moderate or severe) was associated with increased orodigestive cancer mortality [relative risks (RR) = 2.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.17-4.45]; mortality risks also increased with increasing severity of periodontal disease (P trend = 0.01). Periodontitis-associated mortality was in excess for colorectal (RR = 3.58; 95% CI = 1.15-11.16) and possibly for pancreatic cancer (RR = 4.56; 95% CI = 0.93-22.29). Greater serum P. gingivalis IgG tended to be associated overall with increased orodigestive cancer mortality (P trend = 0.06); P. gingivalis-associated excess orodigestive mortality was also found for healthy subjects not exhibiting overt periodontal disease (RR = 2.25; 95% CI = 1.23-4.14). Orodigestive cancer mortality is related to periodontitis and to the periodontal pathogen, P. gingivalis, independent of periodontal disease. Porphyromonas gingivalis is a biomarker for microbe-associated risk of death due to orodigestive cancer. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press.

As such, they function as antimicrobial molecules and play a central role in host defenses against pathogen challenge. However, their ability to recruit leukocytes and potentiate or prolong the inflammatory response may have profound implications for the progression of oral diseases such as chronic periodontitis, where tissue destruction may be widespread. Moreover, it is increasingly recognized that chronic inflammation is a key component of tumor progression. Interaction between cancer cells and their microenvironment is mediated in large part by secreted factors such as chemokines, and serves to enhance the malignant phenotype in oral and other cancers. In this article, we will outline the biological and biochemical mechanisms of chemokine action in host-microbiome interactions in periodontal disease and in oral cancer, and how these may overlap and contribute to pathogenesis. © 2015 Sahingur and Yeudall.","Chemokine;

However, many of these potential OSCC salivary biomarkers are also involved in chronic inflammation, and whether the levels of these biomarkers could be affected by the presence of chronic periodontitis was not known. The objective of this pilot study was therefore to measure the levels of seven previously reported potential OSCC salivary mRNA biomarkers in patients with chronic periodontitis and compare them to levels found in patients with OSCC and healthy controls. The seven salivary mRNAs were interleukin (IL)-8, IL-1β, dual specificity phosphatase 1, H3 histone family 3A, ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1, S100 calcium-binding protein P (S100P) and spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1. Material and Methods: Unstimulated whole saliva samples were collected from a total of 105 human subjects from the following four study groups: OSCC; CPNS (chronic periodontitis, moderate to severe degree, non-smokers); CPS (chronic periodontitis, moderate to severe degree, smokers); and healthy controls. Levels of each mRNA in patient groups (OSCC or chronic periodontitis) relative to the healthy controls were determined by a pre-amplification reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction approach with nested gene-specific primers. Results were recorded and analyzed by the Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time System. Mean fold changes between each pair of patient vs. control groups were analyzed by the Mann–Whitney U-test with Bonferroni corrections. Results: Only S100P showed significantly higher levels in patients with OSCC compared to both patients with CPNS (p = 0.003) and CPS (p = 0.007). The difference in S100P levels between patients with OSCC and healthy controls was also marginally significant (p = 0.009). There was no significant difference in the levels of salivary IL-8, IL-1β and dual specificity phosphatase 1 mRNAs between patients with OSCC and patients with CPNS (p = 0.510, 0.058 and 0.078, respectively); no significant difference in levels of salivary ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1 and spermine N1-acetyltransferase mRNAs between patients with OSCC and patients with CPS (p = 0.318 and 0.764, respectively); and no significant difference in levels of the H3 histone family 3A mRNA between patients with OSCC and either CPS (p = 0.449) or healthy controls (p = 0.107). Conclusions: Salivary S100P mRNA could be a reliable biomarker for OSCC detection, regardless of the presence of chronic periodontitis. The presence of chronic periodontitis could significantly affect the levels of the other six mRNAs, and negatively influence reliability for using them as biomarkers for oral cancer detection. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Diseases that it lays down can have systemic scope and significantlyaffect the quality of life of individuals who suffer them. Periodontal disease is one of the oral health problems that most often affect the global population, lack of treatment leads to loss of tooth organs and consequently alters the digestion and nutrition, without considering other relevant aspects as phonation, aesthetics and social or emotional impact. The importance of periodontal disease has raised possible bidirectional relationships with systemic diseases such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. We address herein the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenicity of periodontal disease. In the same context, another disease that has become relevant in our days is the oral cancer .Detection of the reactive oxygen species in the periodontitis patients and oralcancer patients reveal the relationship between the oxidative stress in periodontitis and oral cancer patients.","Oxidative Stress; Oxygen species; Periodontitis","8 hydroxy 22 deoxyguanosine; glutathione peroxidase; malonaldehyde; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; Article; cancer patient; case control study; chronic periodontitis; clinical article; controlled study; ELISA kit; human; mouth cancer; oxidative stress; pathogenicity","","glutathione peroxidase, 9013-66-5; malonaldehyde, 542-78-9; superoxide dismutase, 37294-21-6, 9016-01-7, 9054-89-1","ELISA kit, Cayman","Cayman","","","Chandra K., Syed A., AbidMohd S., Khan R., Ali N., Protection against fca induced oxidative stress induced DNA damage as a model of arthritis and in vitro anti-arthritic potential of costusspeciosus rhizome extract, International Journal of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemical Research, 7, 2, pp. 383-389, (2015); Parellada M., Moreno C., Mac-Dowell K., Leza J.C., Giraldez M., Bailon C., Castro C., Miranda-Azpiazu P., Arango F.D., Plasma antioxidant capacity is reduced in Asperger syndrome, J Psychiatr Res, 46, 3, pp. 394-401, (2012); A meta-analysis, MolNeurobiol. 2015 Jun, 51, 3, pp. 932-946; Ab Halliwell B., Oxidative stress and cancer: Have we moved forward?""

Breast cancer incidence was registered from 1985 to 2001 according to the WHO International Classification of Diseases criteria. At baseline, 1676 individuals also underwent a clinical oral examination (Group A) whereas 1597 subjects were not clinically examined but were registered (Group B). The associations between breast cancer, periodontal disease, and missing molars were determined using multiple logistic regression models with several background variables and known risk factors for cancer. In total 26 subjects in group A and 15 subjects in group B had breast cancer. The incidence of breast cancer was 1.75% in subjects who had periodontal disease and/or any missing molars, and 0 in subjects who had periodontal disease but had no missing molars. For periodontally healthy subjects with no missing teeth the breast cancer incidence was 1%. For group B the respective incidence was 0.94%. Female gender (odds ratio (OR) 13.08) and missing any molar in the mandible (OR 2.36) were explanatory variables for breast cancer. Of the subjects with periodontal disease and any missing molars in the mandible 5.5% had breast cancer in comparison to 0.5% of the subjects who had periodontal disease but no missing molars in the mandible (P < 0.02). Chronic periodontal disease indicated by missing molars seemed to associate statistically with breast cancer. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Breast cancer; Missing molar teeth; Periodontitis","Adult; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Male; Periodontal Diseases; Prevalence; Risk Factors; adult; article; breast cancer; cancer incidence; cancer risk; controlled study; disease association; education; female; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; molar tooth; mouth examination; periodontal disease; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; sex difference; smoking; social status","","","","","Helsingin ja Uudenmaan Sairaanhoitopiiri, HUS; AFA Försäkring; Karolinska Institutet, KI, (TI020Y0003)","Acknowledgments The Swedish Heart–Lung Foundation, the AFA Insurance, Sweden, Philips Oral Healthcare, Inc and the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, and by Grant TI020Y0003 from the Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland.

The relationship between periodontal disease and oral cancer has been examined for several decades, but there is increasing interest in the link between periodontal disease and overall cancer risk, with systemic inflammation serving as the main focus for biological plausibility. Numerous case-control studies have addressed the role of oral health in head and neck cancer, and several cohort studies have examined associations with other types of cancers over the past decade. For this review, we included studies that were identified from either 11 published reviews on this topic or an updated literature search on PubMed (between 2011 and July 2016). A total of 50 studies from 46 publications were included in this review. Meta-Analyses were conducted on cohort and case-control studies separately when at least 4 studies could be included to determine summary estimates of the risk of cancer in relation to 1) periodontal disease or 2) tooth number (a surrogate marker of periodontal disease) with adjustment for smoking. Existing data provide support for a positive association between periodontal disease and risk of oral, lung, and pancreatic cancers; however, additional prospective studies are needed to better inform on the strength of these associations and to determine whether other cancers are associated with periodontal disease. Future studies should include sufficiently large sample sizes, improved measurements for periodontal disease, and thorough adjustment for smoking and other risk factors. © The Author 2017.","Cancer; Meta-Analysis; Periodontal disease; Periodontitis; Review","Gingivitis; Humans; Neoplasms; Periodontal Diseases; Periodontitis; Risk Factors; Smoking; Tooth Loss; Article; cancer risk; case control study; cohort analysis; disease marker; human; lung cancer; Medline; meta analysis; mouth cancer; pancreas cancer; periodontal disease; priority journal; prospective study; publication; risk factor; gingivitis; neoplasm; periodontal disease; periodontitis; smoking","","","","","National Cancer Institute, NCI, (R01CA166150)","This work was supported by National Cancer Institute grant R01CA166150","Papadopoulos G., Kramer C.D., Slocum C.S., Et al., A mouse model for pathogen-induced chronic inflammation at local and systemic sites, J Vis Exp., 90, (2014); Joshipura K.J., Wand H.C., Merchant A.T., Et al., Periodontal disease and biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease, J Dent Res, 83, 2, pp. 151-155, (2004); Ebersole J.L., Machen R.L., Steffen M.J., Et al., Systemic acutephase reactants, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin, in adult periodontitis, Clin Exp Immunol, 107, 2, pp. 347-352, (1997); Deng T., Lyon C.J., Bergin S., Et al., Obesity, inflammation, and cancer, Annu Rev Pathol., 11, pp. 421-449, (2016); Koene R.J., Prizment A.E., Blaes A., Et al., Shared risk factors in cardiovascular disease and cancer, Circulation, 133, 11, pp. 1104-1114, (2016); Eke P.I., Dye B.A., Wei L., Et al., Update on prevalence of periodontitis in adults in the United States: NHANES 2009 to 2012, J Periodontol., 86, 5, pp. 611-622, (2015); Eke P.I., Dye B.A., Wei L., Et al., Prevalence of periodontitis in adults in the United States: 2009 and 2010, J Dent Res, 91, 10, pp. 914-920, (2012); Holtfreter B., Kocher T., Hoffmann T., Et al., Prevalence of periodontal disease and treatment demands based on a German dental survey (DMS IV), J Clin Periodontol, 37, 3, pp. 211-219, (2010); Eke P.I., Genco R.J., CDC Periodontal Disease Surveillance Project: Background, objectives, and progress report, J Periodontol, 78, 7, pp. 1366-1371, (2007); Bourgeois D., Bouchard P., Mattout C., Epidemiology of periodontal status in dentate adults in France, 2002-2003, J Periodontal Res, 42, 3, pp. 219-227, (2007); Michaud D.S., Liu Y., Meyer M., Et al., Periodontal disease, tooth loss, and cancer risk in male health professionals: A prospective cohort study, Lancet Oncol, 9, 6, pp. 550-558, (2008); Ahn J., Segers S., Hayes R.B., Periodontal disease, Porphyromonas gingivalis serum antibody levels and orodigestive cancer mortality, Carcinogenesis, 33, 5, pp. 1055-1058, (2012); Mai X., LaMonte M.J., Hovey K.M., Et al., Periodontal disease severity and cancer risk in postmenopausal women: The Buffalo OsteoPerio Study, Cancer Causes Control, 27, 2, pp. 217-228, (2016); Fitzpatrick S.G., Katz J., The association between periodontal disease and cancer: A review of the literature, J Dent., 38, 2, pp. 83-95, (2010); Javed F., Warnakulasuriya S., Is there a relationship between periodontal disease and oral cancer?

Periodontal disease and periodontal pathogens have been associated with several systemic diseases and more recently, several studies have suggested the relationship between periodontal disease and cancer. Studies with adjustment for the effect of smoking exposure, have found significant positive associations with different cancer sites. This review has outlined recent epidemiologic researches pointing to a possible role for tooth loss and periodontal disease in carcinogenesis. Methods: In this review, articles were selected from PubMed between1995 and June 2010 including human. Amongst 5,984 articles identified from the electronic search, 17 articles were selected for a full-text reading based on the inclusion and the exclusion criteria. Results: Nine out of 10 case-control studies reported a significant increase in the risk of oral cancer in patients with periodontitis and one with no significant association. Among 6 studies examining esophageal cancer and periodontal disease, 5 studies found a significant association between them and one study failed to find a significant increased risk of cancer. Also amongst 5 studies which focused on upper gastrointestinal, gastric cancer, and periodontal disease, 4 studies found an increased risk of cancer while one study did not report any relationship. In lung cancer evaluations, 3 out of 4 studies showed some levels of association between lung cancer and periodontal disease but after adjustment for smoking, no relationship were found. Three cohort studies have evaluated overall cancer rates in periodontal patients; two of them found small but significant association between cancers and periodontal disease. Conclusion: The results indicate that there is a possible link between cancer and severe periodontal disease after adjustment for smoking and drinking habits.","Mouth neoplasm; Oral hygiene; Periodontitis;

Methods: In the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, a prospective cohort of postmenopausal women, 73,737 women without previous breast cancer were followed. Incident, primary, invasive breast tumors were verified by physician adjudication. Periodontal disease was by self-report. HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards, adjusted for breast cancer risk factors. Because the oral microbiome of those with periodontal disease differs with smoking status, we examined associations stratified by smoking. Results: 2,124 incident, invasive breast cancer cases were identified after mean follow-up of 6.7 years. Periodontal disease, reported by 26.1% of women, was associated with increased breast cancer risk (HR 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03-1.26), particularly among former smokers who quit within 20 years (HR 1.36; 95% CI, 1.05-1.77). Among current smokers, the trend was similar (HR 1.32; 95% CI, 0.83-2.11); there were few cases (n = 74) and the CI included the null. The population attributable fraction was 12.06% (95% CI, 1.12-21.79) and 10.90% (95% CI, 10.31-28.94) for periodontal disease among former smokers quitting within 20 years and current smokers, respectively. Conclusion: Periodontal disease, a common chronic inflammatory disorder, was associated with increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, particularly among former smokers who quit in the past 20 years. Impact: Understanding a possible role of the oral microbiome in breast carcinogenesis could impact prevention. ©2015 AACR.","","Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Staging; Periodontal Diseases; Postmenopause; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Women's Health; aged; Breast Neoplasms; cancer staging; complication; female; follow up; human; middle aged; periodontal disease; postmenopause; prognosis; prospective study; tumor invasion; women's health","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, (HHSN268201100001C, HHSN268201100002C, HHSN268201100003C, HHSN268201100004C, HHSN268201100046C, HHSN271201100004C); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI; National Cancer Institute, NCI, (R25CA113951)","This work and the WHI program are funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services through contracts (HHSN268201100046C, HHSN268201100001C, HHSN268201100002C, HHSN268201100003C, HHSN268201100004C, and HHSN271201100004C); X.

Materials and Methods: A total of 81 men with a mean age of 68.5 years who had prostate cancer were consecutively recruited among 325 enrolled in an academic osteoporosis study. Of these men 68 were eligible to participate in the research. The prevalence of periodontal disease in 41 men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation for a mean of 1.5 years was compared to that in 27 with prostate cancer not undergoing androgen deprivation, who served as controls. The prevalence of periodontal disease was examined in relation to bone mineral density in men with prostate cancer with and without androgen deprivation therapy. A periodontist (PF) blinded to androgen deprivation status recorded probing depth, clinical attachment level, bleeding, plaque scores, gingival recession, missing teeth and calculus. Logistic regression models were used to test the association between androgen deprivation therapy and periodontal disease. Linear regression models were used to assess the association between periodontal disease and bone mineral density in the 2 groups with prostate cancer (treated/untreated). We adjusted for variables known to influence periodontal disease, including patient age, race, smoking and periodontal disease history. Results: The prevalence of periodontal disease was 80.5% in men on androgen deprivation therapy compared with 3.7% in those not on androgen deprivation therapy (OR 3.33, 95% CI 1.07-10.35). Men on androgen deprivation therapy had significantly greater probing depth and higher plaque scores (p <0.001 and <0.09, respectively). A total of 81 men (76.9%) completed bone mineral density examinations. There was no relationship between bone mineral density and periodontal disease. Conclusions: Men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy were more likely to have periodontal disease than men not on androgen deprivation therapy. If confirmed in larger studies, this observation could have important public health implications, given the increasing use of androgen deprivation therapy to treat prostate cancer. © 2007 American Urological Association.","androgen antagonists; osteoporosis; periodontal diseases; prostate; prostatic neoplasms","Aged; Androgen Antagonists; Bone Density; Case-Control Studies; Humans; Male; Periodontal Diseases; Prevalence; Prostatic Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; androgen; adult; aged; androgen deficiency; article; bleeding; bone density; cancer research; confidence interval; controlled study; gingiva disease; human; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; medical record; osteoporosis; periodontal disease; prevalence; priority journal; prostate cancer; smoking; tooth plaque","","Androgen Antagonists, ","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (P30AG024827); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK, (K24DK062895); National Center for Research Resources, NCRR, (M01RR000056); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS, (UL1TR000005)","","Ross R.W., Small E.J., Osteoporosis in men treated with androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer, J Urol, 167, (2002); Wei J.T., Gross M., Jaffe C.A., Gravlin K., Lahie M., Faerber G.J., Et al., Androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer results in significant loss of bone density, Urology, 54, (1999); Diamond T., Campbell J., Bryant C., Lynch W., The effect of combined androgen blockade on bone turnover and bone mineral densities in men treated for prostate carcinoma: longitudinal evaluation and response to intermittent cyclic etidronate therapy, Cancer, 83, (1998); Morote J., Martinez E., Trilla E., Esquena S., Abascal J.M., Encabo G., Et al., Osteoporosis during continuous androgen deprivation: Influence of the modality and length of treatment, Eur Urol, 44, (2003); Deng J.H., Yang L.P., Wang L.S., Zhou D.F., Effect of androgen-deprivation therapy on bone mineral density in prostate cancer patients, Asian J Androl, 6, (2004); Higano C.S., Management of bone loss in men with prostate cancer, J Urol, part 2, 170, (2003); Seeman E., Osteoporosis in men, Baillieres Clin Rheumatol, 11, (1997); Seeman E., Eisman J.A., Treatment of osteoporosis: why, whom, when and how to treat.

Periodontitis is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and, experimentally, with measures of atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction. Periodontal therapy may reduce atherosclerotic changes and improve endothelial function. Preliminary findings suggest a role for the genetic locus ANRIL in the pathobiology of both CVD and periodontitis. Periodontal pathogens induce anticardiolipin in periodontitis patients by molecular mimicry of the serum protein β-2 glycoprotein I. These antibodies have biological and pathological activities consistent with those reported for other infection-induced antiphospholipid antibodies. Anticardiolipin may explain some of the observed associations between periodontitis and systemic conditions such as CVD and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The oral commensal Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) becomes pathogenic on migration to extra-oral sites. Fn infection of the fetal-placental unit has been linked to pregnancy complications, including preterm birth, stillbirth, and early-onset neonatal sepsis. Reagents aimed at inhibiting or resolving inflammatory responses may be used to treat or prevent pregnancy complications due to bacterial infection. Chronic periodontitis may be independently associated with head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) through direct toxic effects of bacteria and their products, and/or through indirect effects of inflammation. Additionally, chronic periodontitis may facilitate the acquisition and persistence of oral HPV infection, a recently emerged risk factor for HNSCC.

It is based on evidence that a continuous long-term exposure to oral bacteremia and bacterial toxins induces inflammatory immune response after immune evasion releases growth factors such as FGF, EGF, TGF-Beta, free radicals such as ROS and NOS, cytokines such as TNFAlfa, IL-1 Beta, IL-6; and matrix metalloproteinase such as MMP-9. Immature myeloid cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells and granulocytes involved in chronic inflammation and tumor progression through immunosuppressive activity against innate and adaptive immunity by factors such as iNOS, Arginase1 and ROS, activate major transcriptional factors such as NF-KB and STAT3 that could contribute to genetic instability, uncontrolled cell proliferation, angiogenesis, resistance to apoptosis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, immunosuppression, invasion and metastasis. This study is a product of research and analysis on the role of chronic inflammatory mediators of chronic periodontitis in progression to cancer.

Study design: Digital panoramic radiographs of 201 subjects were evaluated for calcifications projected in the carotid artery bifurcation area as well as for alveolar bone loss as a result of periodontal disease. Inclusion criteria were unobscured carotid artery bifurcation regions bilaterally and sufficient index teeth present with a definable cemento-enamel junction and alveolar crest. Radiographs were independently observed for carotid area calcifications and for periodontal status. Image enhancements permitted for detection of calcifications projected in the carotid area included window/level, inverse, and emboss. Periodontal measurements were made on index teeth using proprietary imaging software and a mouse-driven measurement algorithm. A 3-factor analysis of variance was performed with 3 between-subjects comparisons. Percentage of bone loss was the dependent variable. Independent variables were age, subject sex, and the presence or absence of carotid area calcifications. Results: Differences measured in percentage of bone loss between sexes were not statistically significant. While bone loss did increase with age, comparison of the mean bone loss of each age category revealed no statistical significance. There was a highly significant correlation between carotid artery area calcifications visible on panoramic radiographs and percent alveolar bone loss. Radiographs showing unilateral and bilateral calcifications had a mean percent bone loss of 24.2% ± 12.6% and 25.7% ± 13.0% respectively, compared to those with no calcification at 10.4% ± 9.9%. Conclusions: Nearly 1 in 4 subjects in this study evidenced calcifications projected in the carotid bifurcation region. The finding of such calcifications was significantly related to the calculated percentage of alveolar bone loss. © 2007 Mosby, Inc.

The aim of this study is to provide a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the relationship between PD, edentulism, and pancreatic cancer (PC).; Patients and methods: From an initial review of 327 references we selected eight studies concerning periodontitis or edentulism with sufficient quantitative information to allow us to examine the risk of PC. We used relative risks (RRs), hazard ratios, or odds ratios to measure the association between periodontitis, edentulism, and PC. We employed random effects models to obtain summary risks, and we also provide measures of study differences and possible biases.; Results: The summary RR for periodontitis and PC was 1.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41-2.15] and 1.54 for edentulism (95% CI 1.16-2.05). There was no evidence of heterogeneity for either variable, and no evidence of publication bias. The studies included reports from three continents, suggesting that the association is generalizable. Most of the studies were adjusted for variables thought to be associated with PC, such as gender, smoking, BMI, diabetes, and alcohol.; Conclusions: Using meta-analysis, both periodontitis and edentulism appear to be associated with PC, even after adjusting for common risk factors. As yet, the mechanisms linking oral disease and PC are uncertain, but could be related to changes in the oral microbiome-an area of current research.","edentulism; meta-analysis; pancreas cancer; periodontal disease; periodontitis","Animals; Causality; Humans; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Periodontal Diseases; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Factors; Tooth Loss; animal; causality; complication; human; meta analysis; mortality; pancreas tumor; periodontal disease; proportional hazards model; risk factor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15698041","","","28453689","English","Ann.

Our aim was to determine the periodontitis rate in our cohort of esophageal cancer patients. We also analyzed whether preoperative dental examination and care reduces the likelihood of severe pneumonia after esophagectomy. Study Design: Between 2003 and 2014, 529 esophageal cancer patients received esophagectomy at Akita University Hospital. We studied 232 patients who had preoperative dental examinations and care (dental care group) retrospectively and assessed the severity of their periodontitis. The dental care group was compared to 297 patients who did not have preoperative dental care (control group) with respect to the incidence of severe pneumonia after esophagectomy. Results: Ninety-one patients (39.2%) in the dental care group were diagnosed with slight periodontitis and 69 (29.7%) were diagnosed with severe periodontitis. Among all the patients, 69 patients (13.0%) were diagnosed with grade 3B postoperative severe pneumonia. The dental care group had a significantly lower incidence of severe pneumonia than the control group. Moreover, multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that anastomotic leakage, preoperative dental care, gender and %VC were correlated significantly with the occurrence of postoperative severe pneumonia.

Previous findings may reflect residual confounding by smoking. The study aims to determine whether history of PD diagnosis is associated with incident lung cancer in a large cohort of postmenopausal women. Methods: Prospective analyses were conducted in a cohort of 77,485 postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study. History of PD (prevalence of 26.1 %) was self-reported, and 754 incident lung cancer cases occurred during an average 6.8 (SD ± 2.6) years of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Overall, PD was positively associated with lung cancer risk after adjusting for detailed smoking history including smoking status and pack-years of smoking (HR 1.24, 95 % CI 1.07-1.45). There was a positive additive interaction between PD with pack-years of smoking (p = 0.02), suggesting a potential synergistic effect between PD and smoking intensity on lung cancer. The association between PD and lung cancer was stronger in former smokers. When restricted to never-smokers, PD was not associated with lung cancer (HR 1.02, 95 % CI 0.68-1.53). Conclusions: Periodontal disease was not independently associated with lung cancer in non-smoking postmenopausal women. However, smoking and PD jointly increased lung cancer risk beyond that expected from the sum of the each effect separately. The potential synergism between PD and smoking on lung cancer warrants further examination. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","Chronic inflammation; Interaction; Lung cancer; Periodontal disease; Post menopause; Smoking","Aged; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Incidence; Lung Neoplasms; Middle Aged; Periodontal Diseases; Postmenopause; Smoking; United States; Women's Health; age; aged; alcohol consumption; article; cancer incidence; cancer risk; cancer susceptibility; disease association; female; follow up; health status; hormone substitution; human; lung cancer; major clinical study; medical history; obesity; periodontal disease; physical activity; postmenopause; preventive dentistry; priority journal; prospective study; self report; smoking habit; cohort analysis; incidence; Lung Neoplasms; middle aged; Periodontal Diseases; smoking; United States; women's health","","","","","Interdisciplinary Training in Cancer Epidemiology; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (N01WH022110, N01WH032100, N01WH032101, N01WH032102, N01WH032105, N01WH032106, N01WH032108, N01WH032109, N01WH032111, N01WH032112, N01WH032113, N01WH032115, N01WH032118, N01WH032119, N01WH032122, N01WH042107, N01WH042108, N01WH042109, N01WH042110, N01WH042111, N01WH042112, N01WH042113, N01WH042114, N01WH042115, N01WH042116, N01WH042117, N01WH042118, N01WH042119, N01WH042120, N01WH042121, N01WH042122, N01WH042123, N01WH042124, N01WH042125, N01WH042126, N01WH042129, N01WH042130, N01WH042131, N01WH042132); U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, (24152, 32100–2, 32105–6, 32108–9, 32111–13, 32115, 32118–32119, 32122, 42107–26, 42129–32, 44221, HHSN2682011000 04C, HHSN268201100001C, HHSN268201100002C, HHSN268201100003C, HHSN268201100046C, HHSN271201100004C, N01WH22110); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI; National Cancer Institute, NCI, (R25CA113951); National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR, (OS950077, R01DE013505)","Acknowledgments This work was supported by the WHI program which is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, US Department of Health and Human Services through contracts N01WH22110, 24152, 32100–2, 32105–6, 32108–9, 32111–13, 32115, 32118–32119, 32122, 42107–26, 42129–32, 44221, HHSN268201100046C, HHSN268201100001C, HHSN268201100002C, HHSN268201100003C, HHSN2682011000 04C, and HHSN271201100004C; R01DE013505 from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., to Dr. Wactawski-Wende, and US Army, Medical Research and Materiel Command, Fort Detrick, Md., Grant OS950077 to Dr. Wactawski-Wende.

Methods Fifty-four patients with newly diagnosed early-stage solid tumour malignancy treated by surgery and eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled in this study. Clinical periodontal parameters obtained by a single calibrated examiner were evaluated before chemotherapy (T0), 21 days after chemotherapy (T1) and 210 days after chemotherapy (T2). Patients were grouped into healthy or periodontally diseased subjects. All patients received oral hygiene instructions, and the diseased patients received periodontal treatment at baseline. Comparisons between the groups were performed using the McNemar test (P > 0.05) and the Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction (P < 0.02) using spss software. Results Of 54 patients enrolled in the study, two did not present to the third assessment (T2). The prevalence of periodontitis was 35.2% at baseline and no significant difference was found in the follow-up assessments. There was a statistically significant reduction in probing depth (PD), plaque index (PI) and bleeding on probing (BOP) between baseline and follow-up assessments. The attachment level (AL) did not vary significantly between the different follow-up periods (P ≥ 0.06). Conclusions Periodontal treatment was effective in reducing PI, BOP and PD and in maintaining AL in periodontitis cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. © 2014 FDI World Dental Federation.","cancer patients; Chemotherapy; periodontal treatment; periodontitis","Adult; Aged; Anti-Infective Agents, Local; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Chlorhexidine; Dental Plaque Index; Dental Scaling; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mouthwashes; Neoplasm Staging; Neoplasms; Oral Hygiene; Periodontal Attachment Loss; Periodontal Index; Periodontal Pocket; Periodontitis; Root Planing; antineoplastic agent; chlorhexidine; mouthwash; topical antiinfective agent; adjuvant chemotherapy; adult; aged; cancer staging; classification; comparative study; education; female; follow up; human; male; middle aged; mouth hygiene; Neoplasms; Periodontal Attachment Loss; periodontal pocket; periodontics; periodontitis; preventive dentistry; procedures; tooth plaque","","chlorhexidine, 3697-42-5, 55-56-1; Anti-Infective Agents, Local, ; Chlorhexidine, ; Mouthwashes, ","","","","","Wong H.M., Oral complications and management strategies for patients undergoing cancer therapy, Scientific World J, 2014, (2014); Mosel D.D., Bauer R.L., Lynch D.P., Et al., Oral complications in the treatment of cancer patients, Oral Dis, 17, pp. 550-559, (2011); Hong C.H.L., Napenas J.L., Hodgson B.D., Et al., A systematic review of dental disease in patients undergoing cancer therapy, Support Care Cancer, 18, pp. 1007-1021, (2010); Joshi V.K., Dental treatment planning and management for the mouth cancer patient, Oral Oncol, 46, pp. 475-479, (2010); Epstein J.B., Stevenson-Moore P., Periodontal disease and periodontal management in patients with cancer, Oral Oncol, 37, pp. 613-619, (2001); Jensen S.B., Mouridsen H.T., Bergmann O.J., Et al., Oral mucosal lesions, microbial changes, and taste disturbances induced by adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients, Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod, 106, pp. 217-226, (2008); Mantovani A., Allavena P., Sica A., Et al., Cancer-related inflammation, Nature, 454, pp. 436-444, (2008); D'Aiuto F., Parkar M., Andreou G., Et al., Periodontitis and systemic inflammation: Control of the local infection is associated with a reduction in serum inflammatory markers, J Dent Res, 83, pp. 156-160, (2004); Armitage G.C., The complete periodontal examination, Periodontol 2000, 34, pp. 22-33, (2004); Anderegg C.R., Metzler D.G., Tooth mobility revisited, J Periodontol, 72, pp. 963-967, (2001); Loe H., The Gingival Index, the Plaque Index and the Retention Index Systems, J Periodontol, 38, pp. 610-616, (1967); Page R.C., Eke P.I., Case definitions for use in population- based surveillance of periodontitis, J Periodontol, 78, pp. 1397-1399, (2007); Heimdahl A., Prevention and management of oral infections in cancer patients, Support Care Cancer, 7, pp. 224-228, (1999); Champagne C.M.E., Buchanan W., Reddy M.S., Et al., Potential for gingival crevice fluid measures as predictors of risk for periodontal disease, Periodontol 2000, 31, pp. 167-180, (2003); Paju S., Scannapieco F.A., Oral biofilms, periodontitis, and pulmonary infections, Oral Dis, 13, pp. 508-512, (2007); Mealey B.L., Rose L.F., Diabetes mellitus and inflammatory periodontal diseases, Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes, 15, pp. 135-141, (2008); Tezal M., Sullivan M.A., Hyland A., Et al., Chronic periodontitis and the incidence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev, 18, pp. 2406-2412, (2009); Nogueira M.A., Luna D.G., Bianchini H., Et al., Effect ofsupragingival plaque control on subgingival microflora and gingivo-periodontal tissues, Acta Odontol Latinoam, 13, pp. 73-86, (2000); Rautemaa R., Lauhio A., Cullinan M.P., Et al., Oral infections and systemic disease - An emerging problem in medicine, Clin Microbiol Infect, 13, pp. 1041-1047, (2007); Chang A.E., Hayes D.F., Pass H.I., Et al., Oncology: An Evidence-Based Approach, (2006)","I.

Few epidemiological studies have examined the association between periodontal diseases and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. We collected information on the periodontal disease (defined as history of periodontal bone loss) and number of natural teeth in the Nurses' Health Study. A total of 77,443 women were followed since 1992. We used Cox proportional hazard models to calculate multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) after adjustment for smoking and other known risk factors for CRC. We documented 1,165 incident CRC through 2010. Compared to women with 25–32 teeth, the multivariable HR (95% CI) for CRC for women with <17 teeth was 1.20 (1.04–1.39). With regard to tumor site, the HRs (95% CIs) for the same comparison were 1.23 (1.01–1.51) for proximal colon cancer, 1.03 (0.76–1.38) for distal colon cancer and 1.48 (1.07–2.05) for rectal cancer. In addition, compared to those without periodontal disease, HRs for CRC were 0.91 (95% CI 0.74–1.12) for periodontal disease, and 1.22 (95% CI 0.91–1.63) when limited to moderate to severe periodontal disease. The results were not modified by smoking status, body mass index or alcohol consumption. Women with fewer teeth, possibly moderate or severe periodontal disease, might be at a modest increased risk of developing CRC, suggesting a potential role of oral health in colorectal carcinogenesis. © 2016 UICC","colorectal cancer;

Study Design Five patients with osteonecrosis before dental extraction were studied. Results Periodontal involvement was evidenced by pain, bleeding, fistula, purulence, swelling, periodontal pocket, and tooth mobility. Combined endoperiodontal lesions were considered in 1 patient. Duration of symptoms before ONJ diagnosis lasted 8 to 24 weeks. Routine therapy was performed in 2 of 5 patients. Widening of the periodontal ligament was observed in 4 patients, and dense alveolar bone was seen in 1 patient. Local complications of ONJ required dental extractions in 4 of 5 patients. Spontaneous tooth exfoliation was observed in 1 patient. Alveolar bone biopsies, after the extraction in 2 patients, confirmed osteonecrosis. Osteonecrosis healed in 2 patients - 1 after the dental extraction and 1 after 3 dental extractions and surgical debridement. Postextraction socket healed in 1 patient, and the area with exposed bone remained asymptomatic. Osteonecrosis progressed in 2 patients. Conclusions Clinical and radiologic signs of periodontal tissue involvement, before dental extraction in patients treated with antiresorptives alone or in combination with targeted therapy, may represent developing osteonecrosis. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","","Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Diphosphonates; Fatal Outcome; Female; Humans; Imidazoles; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Periodontal Diseases; Radiography, Panoramic; Retrospective Studies; Tooth Extraction; antineoplastic agent; bisphosphonic acid derivative; bone density conservation agent; ibandronic acid; imidazole derivative; zoledronic acid; aged; Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw; case report; fatality; female; human; male; middle aged; Neoplasms; panoramic radiography; Periodontal Diseases; retrospective study; tooth extraction","","ibandronic acid, 114084-78-5, 138844-81-2, 138926-19-9; zoledronic acid, 118072-93-8, 131654-46-1, 165800-06-6, 165800-07-7; Antineoplastic Agents, ; Bone Density Conservation Agents, ; Diphosphonates, ; ibandronic acid, ; Imidazoles, ; zoledronic acid, ","","","","","Ruggiero S.L., Dodson T.B., Fantasia J., Et al., Medication-related Osteonecrosis of the jaw-2014 Update; Nicolatou-Galitis O., Papadopoulou E., Sarri T., Et al., Osteonecrosis of the jaw in oncology patients treated with bisphosphonates: Prospective experience of a dental oncology center, Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod, 112, pp. 195-202, (2011); Vardas E., Coward T., Papadopoulou E., Nicolatou-Galitis O., Dental extractions as the major local risk factor of bisphosphonates related jaw osteonecrosis in cancer patients receiving intravenous bisphosphonates therapy.

Methods: Study participants were selected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) system database. The PD with a routine treatment cohort contained 38 902 patients. For each treatment cohort participant, two age- and sex-matched comparison (control) cohort participants were randomly selected. Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate the effects of PD with treatment on the subsequent risk of cancer. Results: The overall risk of developing cancer was significantly lower in the treatment cohort than in the patients without treatment (adjusted Hazard ratio = 0.72, 95% confidence interval = 0.68-0.76). The risks of developing most gastrointestinal tract, lung, gynecological and brain malignancies were significantly lower in the treatment cohort than in the comparison cohort. In contrast, the risks of prostate and thyroid cancers were significantly higher in the treatment cohort than in the comparison cohort.

Additional approaches are necessary to change this status quo. Chronic infection and inflammation have been linked to carcinogenesis in few organs. Periodontitis is a chronic oral infection caused by inflammatory reactions in response to gram negative anaerobic bacteria in the endogenous dental plaque. It leads to irreversible destruction of tissues around teeth clinically detectable as periodontal pockets and alveolar bone loss. Periodontal pockets were also suggested as reservoirs for human papillomavirus (HPV). Chronic proliferation and ulceration of the pocket epithelium may help HPV’s acquisition and persistence. The results from our NIH-funded study suggest a robust independent association between the history of periodontitis and incident HNSCC. Analyses from a small subset of this population also suggest a synergy between periodontitis and oral HPV infection. This review will summarize the evidence supporting: 1) the association between chronic periodontitis and HNSCC, 2) HPV-periodontitis synergy, 3) the biological mechanisms behind these two associations, and 4) implications for safe and practical treatment strategies for HNSCC. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","Head and neck cancers; Human papillomavirus; Infection; Inflammation; Periodontitis; Treatment","acetaldehyde; chemokine; endotoxin; growth factor; matrix metalloproteinase; nitrosamine; prostaglandin; reactive nitrogen species; reactive oxygen metabolite; adaptive immunity; alcohol consumption; alveolar bone loss; angiogenesis; apoptosis; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer prevention; carcinogenesis; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell survival; chronic inflammation; chronic periodontitis; dental caries; disease association; disease exacerbation; disease predisposition; DNA damage; gene expression; gingivitis; Gram negative anaerobic bacteria; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; human; immune response; mitochondrial toxicity; mixed infection; molecular pathology; mouth infection; papillomavirus infection; periodontal pocket; priority journal; risk factor; smoking cessation; tooth plaque; tumor suppressor gene; ulcer","","acetaldehyde, 75-07-0; nitrosamine, 35576-91-1","","","National Cancer Institute, NCI, (R03CA119262, T32-DE07034); National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR","This work was supported by grants R03CA119262 from the National Cancer Institute and T32-DE07034 from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research.

The aim of this study was to determine the association between PD and PC using data in the National Health Insurance Service–Health Examinee Cohort (NHIS-HEC). A random stratified sample of 187,934 South Koreans was collected from the NHIS database from 2002 to 2013. We assessed the relationship between PD and PC while adjusting for potential confounding factors (sex, age, household income, insurance status, residence area, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebral infarction, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, smoking status, alcohol intake, and regular exercise). The overall incidence of PC with PD among those aged 40 years and older was 0.28% (n = 531). In the multivariate Cox proportional-hazard regression analysis with adjustment for confounding factors, PD was associated with a 14% higher risk of PC (HR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.01–1.31, P = 0.042). The findings of this study suggest that PD is significantly and positively associated with PC. Further studies are required to identify the mechanisms underlying the links between PD and PC. © Ivyspring International Publisher","Cohort analysis; Periodontal disease; Periodontitis; Prostate cancer","adult; age; aged; alcohol consumption; angina pectoris; Article; brain infarction; cancer incidence; cohort analysis; comorbidity; diabetes mellitus; disease association; exercise; health insurance; health service; heart infarction; household income; human; hypertension; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; middle aged; periodontal disease; prostate cancer; smoking; South Korea","","","","","Wonkwang University; National Health Insurance Service, (2017, NHIS-2017-2-377)","This study used a national sample cohort data of the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS-2017-2-377) and was supported by Wonkwang University in 2017.

The aim of this study was to determine more accurate criterion for the definition of mild and moderate periodontitis case to be applied to head and neck cancer individuals before radiotherapy. Methods: The frequency of periodontitis in a sample of 84 individuals was determined according to different diagnostic criteria: (1) Lopez et al. (2002);(2) Hujoel et al. (2006); (3) Beck et al. (1990); (4) Machtei et al. (1992); (5) Tonetti and Claffey (2005); (6) and Page and Eke (2007). All diagnosis were based on the clinical parameters obtained by a single calibrated examiner (Kw = 0.71). The individuals were evaluated before radiotherapy. They received oral hygiene instructions, and the cases diagnosed with periodontitis (Page and Eke 2007) were treated. The gold standard was the definition 6, and the others were compared by means of agreement, sensitivity (SS), specificity (SP), and the area under ROC curve. The kappa test evaluated the agreement between definitions. Results: The frequency of periodontitis at baseline was 53.6 % (definition 1), 81.0 % (definition 2), 40.5 % (definition 3), 26.2 % (definition 4), 13.1 % (definition 5), and 70.2 % (definition 6). The kappa test showed a moderate agreement between definitions 6 and 2 (59.0 %) and definitions 6 and 1 (56.0 %). The criterion with higher SS (0.92) and SP (0.73) was definition 1. Conclusion: Definition 1 was the most accurate criterion to case periodontitis definition to be applied to head and neck cancer individuals. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Diagnostic criteria; Epidemiology; Periodontitis; Periodontitis/definition","Adult; Aged; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Middle Aged; Periodontitis; ROC Curve; adult; Article; cancer radiotherapy; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease severity; evaluation study; female; gold standard; head and neck cancer; human; major clinical study; male; mouth hygiene; periodontitis; priority journal; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; aged; classification; complication; head and neck tumor; middle aged; periodontitis","","","","","","","Page R.C., Eke P.I., Case definitions for use in population-based surveillance of periodontitis, J Periodontol, 78, pp. 1387-1399, (2007); Savage A., Eaton K.A., Moles D.R., Needleman I., A systematic review of definitions of periodontitis and methods that have been used to identify this disease, J Clin Periodontol, 36, pp. 458-467, (2009); Armitage G.C., Development of a classification system for periodontal diseases and conditions, Ann Periodontol, 4, pp. 1-38, (1999); Manau C., Echeverria A., Agueda A., Guerrero A., Echeverria J.J., Periodontal disease definition may determine the association between periodontitis and pregnancy outcomes, J Clin Periodontol, 35, pp. 385-397, (2008); Martin J.A., Grill A.C., Matthews A.G., Vena D., Thompson V.P., Craig R.G., Curro F.A., Periodontal diagnosis affected by variation in terminology, J Periodontol, 84, 5, pp. 606-613, (2013); Tonetti M.S., Claffey N., Advances in the progression of periodontitis and proposal of definitions of a periodontitis case and disease progression for use in risk factor research.

Recent studies showed a correlation of decreased concentrations of proximal ANRIL transcripts with homozygous carriership of the CAD and PD main risk alleles. To elucidate the relation of these transcripts to disease manifestation, we constructed a short hairpin RNA in a stable inducible knock-down system of T-Rex 293 HEK cell lines, specifically targeting the proximal transcripts EU741058 and DQ485454. By genome-wide expression profiling using Affymetrix HG1.0 ST Arrays,we identified the transcription of ADIPOR1, VAMP3 and C11ORF10 to be correlated with decreased ANRIL expression in a time-dependent manner. We validated these findings on a transcriptional and translational level in different cell types. Exploration of the identified genes for the presence of disease associated variants, using Affymetrix 500K genotyping and Illumina custom genotyping arrays, highlighted a region upstream of VAMP3 within CAMTA1 to be associated with increased risk of CAD [rs10864294 P 5 0.015, odds ratio (OR) 5 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5 1.1-1.6, 1471 cases, 2737 controls] and aggressive PD (AgP; P 5 0.008, OR 5 1.31, 95% CI 5 1.1-1.6, 864 cases, 3664 controls). In silico replication in a meta-analysis of 14 genome-wide association studies of CADof the CARDIoGRAMConsortium identified rs2301462, located on the same haplotype block, as associated with P 5 0.001 upon adjustment for sex and age. Our results give evidence that specific isoforms of ANRIL regulate key genes of glucose and fatty acid metabolism. © The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.

The oral morbidities of radiation therapy include but are not limited to an increased susceptibility to dental caries and periodontal disease. They also include profound and often permanent functional and sensory changes involving the oral soft tissue. These changes range from oral mucositis experienced during and soon after treatment, mucosal opportunistic infections, neurosensory disorders, and tissue fibrosis. Many of the oral soft tissue changes following radiation therapy are difficult challenges to the patients and their caregivers and require life-long strategies to alleviate their deleterious effect on basic life functions and on the quality of life. We discuss the presentation, prognosis, and management strategies of the dental structure and oral soft tissue morbidities resulting from the administration of therapeutic radiation in head and neck patient. A case for a collaborative and integrated multidisciplinary approach to the management of these patients is made, with specific recommendation to include knowledgeable and experienced oral health care professionals in the treatment team. © 2017 The Authors.

The authors propose that both conditions share common genetic risk factors. They analyzed associations between baseline periodontal disease, measured by questionnaire-recorded tooth mobility, and incident cancers, identified by linkage with national registries, between 1963 and 2004 in 15,333 Swedish twins. The authors used co-twin analyses to control for familial factors and undertook analyses restricted to monozygotic twins to further control for confounding by genetic factors. They observed 4,361 cancer cases over 548,913 person-years. After adjustment for covariates, baseline periodontal disease was associated with increased risk of several cancers ranging from 15% for total cancer (proportional hazard ratio (HR) = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 1.32) to 120% for corpus uterine cancer (HR) = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.16, 4.18). Periodontal disease was also associated with increased risk of colorectal (HR) =1.62, 95% CI: 1.13, 2.33), pancreatic (HR) = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.14, 3.75), and prostate (HR) = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.07) cancers. In co-twin analyses, dizygotic twins with baseline periodontal disease showed a 50% increase in total cancer risk (HR) =1.50, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.17), but in monozygotic twins this association was markedly attenuated (HR) = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.63, 1.81). Similar patterns emerged for digestive tract cancers, suggesting that shared genetic risk factors may partially explain associations between periodontal disease and cancers.","Genetics; Neoplasms; Periodontal diseases; Twins","Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Periodontal Diseases; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sweden; Twins, Dizygotic; Twins, Monozygotic; Sweden; cancer; dental health; digestive system disorder; genetic structure; health risk; questionnaire survey; risk factor; adult; aged; article; cancer risk; colorectal cancer; digestive system cancer; disease association; dizygotic twins; female; genetic risk; human; major clinical study; male; monozygotic twins; neoplasm; pancreas cancer; periodontal disease; prostate cancer; uterus cancer","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R01AG008724); National Cancer Institute, NCI, (R01CA085739); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK, (U01DK066134)","","Hujoel P.P., Drangsholt M., Spiekerman C., Et al., An exploration of the periodontitis-cancer association, Ann Epidemiol, 13, 5, pp. 312-316, (2003); Michaud D.S., Joshipura K., Giovannucci E., Et al., A prospective study of periodontal disease and pancreatic cancer in US male health professionals, J Natl Cancer Inst, 99, 2, pp. 171-175, (2007); Michaud D.S., Liu Y., Meyer M., Et al., Periodontal disease, tooth loss, and cancer risk in male health professionals: A prospective cohort study, Lancet Oncol, 9, 6, pp. 550-558, (2008); Pihlstrom B.L., Michalowicz B.S., Johnson N.W., Periodontal diseases, Lancet, 366, 9499, pp. 1809-1820, (2005); Amabile N., Susini G., Pettenati-Soubayroux I., Et al., Severity of periodontal disease correlates to inflammatory systemic status and independently predicts the presence and angiographic extent of stable coronary artery disease, J Intern Med, 263, 6, pp. 644-652, (2008); Coussens L.M., Werb Z., Inflammation and cancer, Nature, 420, 6917, pp. 860-867, (2002); Marx J., Cancer Research.

Periodontitis has been observed infrequently in bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively investigate bevacizumab-related periodontitis in metastatic colorectal cancer patients. Methods: From January 2008 to March 2010, 274 patients received bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy at the National Cancer Center Hospital in Tokyo. Patients who had consulted the dentist for periodontitis were included in the study. We examined the interval between the initiation of the first bevacizumab administration and the day of the consultation with the dentist. Periodontitis was evaluated before and after conservative therapy. Results: Twenty-six patients (9.5 % of the 274 metastatic colorectal cancer patients) were included in this study. The median age was 60 years (range 30-79 years). Nineteen (73 %) patients had a good performance status of 0. The combination regimens used with bevacizumab were infusional 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX, 53 %); infusional 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI, 27 %); capecitabine + oxaliplatin (CapeOX, 8 %); S-1 + oxaliplatin (8 %); and S-1 + irinotecan (4 %). The median time from bevacizumab administration to the consultation with a dentist for periodontitis was 69 days (range 12-390 days), and the median number of bevacizumab administrations was 3.5 (range 1-25). After conservative therapy, 22 (85 %) patients with periodontitis showed an improvement. Conclusions: Periodontitis occurred frequently in patients receiving bevacizumab. The conservative therapy for periodontitis was very effective, and the prophylaxitic treatment was important. © 2012 Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.","Bevacizumab; Colorectal cancer; Periodontitis","Adult; Aged; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Camptothecin; Colorectal Neoplasms; Cyclophosphamide; Disease-Free Survival; Doxorubicin; Female; Fluorouracil; Humans; Leucovorin; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Metastasis; Organoplatinum Compounds; Periodontitis; Prednisone; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Vindesine; bevacizumab; fluorouracil; folinic acid; gimeracil plus oteracil potassium plus tegafur; irinotecan; oxaliplatin; adult; aged; article; cancer combination chemotherapy; clinical article; conservative treatment; drug safety; female; human; Japan; male; metastatic colorectal cancer; periodontitis; priority journal; retrospective study; treatment duration; treatment outcome","","bevacizumab, 216974-75-3; fluorouracil, 51-21-8; folinic acid, 58-05-9; irinotecan, 100286-90-6; oxaliplatin, 61825-94-3","s 1","","Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, MHLW","We thank Ms. Makiko Shinogi and Ms. Hiromi Orita for data collection.

The current study examined the association between PD (periodontitis, gingivitis, and others) and pancreatic cancer. Methods A total of 139,805 subjects with PD and 75,085 subjects without PD were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to compare the incidence of pancreatic cancer between the 2 groups. Results Periodontal disease was positively associated with pancreatic cancer risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-2.33). This positive association occurred predominantly among those aged 65 years or older (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.03-4.57) and was not observed among those aged younger than 65 years (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.52-1.34). Further analysis showed that PD is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer independent of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, allergies, viral hepatitis, peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (as a proxy for cigarette smoking), and alcoholic-related conditions (as a proxy for alcohol drinking). Conclusions Our results indicated a significantly positive association between PD and risk of pancreatic cancer.

Few studies have examined periodontal disease as a risk factor for total cancer, and none have focused on older women. We examined whether periodontal disease is associated with incident cancer among postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study. Methods: Our prospective cohort study comprised 65, 869 women, ages 54 to 86 years. Periodontal disease information was obtained via self-report questionnaires administered between 1999 and 2003, whereas ascertainment of cancer outcomes occurred through September 2013, with a maximum follow-up period of 15 years. Physician-adjudicated incident total cancers were the main outcomes and site-specific cancers were secondary outcomes. HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. All analyses were conducted two-sided. Results: During a mean follow-up of 8.32 years, 7, 149 cancers were identified. Periodontal disease history was associated with increased total cancer risk (multivariable-adjusted HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.08-1.20); findings were similar in analyses limited to 34, 097 never-smokers (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04-1.22). Associations were observed for breast (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.23), lung (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.14- 1.51), esophagus (HR, 3.28; 95% CI, 1.64-6.53), gallbladder (HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.01-2.95), and melanoma skin (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02-1.48) cancers. Stomach cancer was borderline (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.94-2.67). Conclusions: Periodontal disease increases risk of total cancer among older women, irrespective of smoking, and certain anatomic sites appear to be vulnerable. Impact: Our findings support the need for further understanding of the effect of periodontal disease on cancer outcomes. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.","","Aged; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Incidence; Neoplasms; Periodontal Diseases; Postmenopause; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Women's Health; alcohol; calcium; estrogen; gestagen; vitamin D; adult; aged; alcohol consumption; Article; body mass; breast cancer; bronchus cancer; calcium intake; caloric intake; cancer risk; cohort analysis; colon cancer; diabetes mellitus; digestive system cancer; educational status; esophagus cancer; family history; female; follow up; gallbladder cancer; hematopoietic system malignancy; human; lung cancer; major clinical study; medical history; passive smoking; periodontal disease; pharynx cancer; physical activity; postmenopause; priority journal; prospective study; rectum cancer; self report; skin cancer; smoking; stomach cancer; urogenital tract cancer; vegetable; vitamin intake; complication; incidence; neoplasm; pathology; periodontal disease; postmenopause; risk factor; women's health","","alcohol, 64-17-5; calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5","","","Medical Research and Materiel Command, Fort Detrick, (OS950077); National Institutes of Health, NIH, (N01WH022110); U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, (24152, 32100-2, 32105-6, 32108-9, 32111-13, 32115, 32118-32119, 32122, 42107-26, 42129-32, 44221, HHSN268201100001C, HHSN268201100002C, HHSN268201100003C, HHSN268201100004C, HHSN268201100046C, HHSN271201100004C, N01WH22110); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI; National Cancer Institute, NCI, (R25CA113951); National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR, (R01DE013505); U.S. Army","This work was supported by the WHI program which is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services through contracts N01WH22110, 24152, 32100-2, 32105-6, 32108-9, 32111-13, 32115, 32118-32119, 32122, 42107-26, 42129-32, 44221, HHSN268201100046C, HHSN268201100001C, HHSN268201100002C, HHSN268201100003C, HHSN268201100004C, and HHSN271201100004C, R01DE013505 from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (to J.

We assessed cancer risk in a cohort of patients with moderate to severe periodontitis. Methods: Patients diagnosed with moderate to severe periodontitis by a periodontist between 2001 and 2010 were identified from the hospital registry. Patients younger than 35 years of age or with a prior cancer diagnosis were excluded. The age- and gender-standardized incidence rates (SIR) were calculated by dividing the number of observed cases by the number of expected cases from Turkish National Cancer Registry 2013 data. Results: A total of 280 patients were included (median age 49.6, 54% female). Median follow-up was 12 years. Twenty-five new cancer cases were observed. Patients with periodontitis had 77% increased risk of cancer (SIR 1.77, 95% CI 1.17–2.58, p =.004). Women with periodontitis had significantly higher risk of breast cancer (SIR 2.40, 95% CI 0.88–5.33) and men with periodontitis had significantly higher risk of prostate cancer (SIR 3.75, 95% CI 0.95–10.21) and hematological cancers (SIR 6.97, 95% CI 1.77–18.98). Conclusion: Although showing a causal association necessitates further investigation, our results support the idea that periodontitis might be associated with increased cancer risk, particularly with hematological, breast and prostate cancers. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","breast cancer; cancer risk; lymphoma; Periodontitis; prostate cancer","Adult; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Cohort Studies; Female; Hematologic Neoplasms; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Periodontitis; Prostatic Neoplasms; Registries; Risk; adult; age; aged; Article; bladder cancer; breast cancer; cancer epidemiology; cancer incidence; cancer registry; cancer risk; causality; clinical observation; cohort analysis; disease association; female; follow up; gender; hematologic malignancy; high risk patient; human; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; middle aged; neurofibroma; ovary cancer; periodontitis; prostate cancer; renal cell carcinoma; retrospective study; risk factor; skin carcinoma; standardized incidence ratio; stomach cancer; teratoma; thyroid cancer; breast tumor; hematologic disease; incidence; periodontitis; prostate tumor; register; risk","","","","","","","Eke P.I., Dye B.A., Wei L., Et al., Prevalence of periodontitis in adults in the United States: 2009 and 2010, J Dent Res, 91, pp. 914-920, (2012); Kassebaum N.J., Bernabe E., Dahiya M., Et al., Global burden of severe periodontitis in 1990–2010: a systematic review and meta-regression, J Dent Res, 93, pp. 1045-1053, (2014); Tsai C., Hayes C., Taylor G.W., Glycemic control of type 2 diabetes and severe periodontal disease in the US adult population, Community Dent Oral Epidemiol, 30, pp. 182-192, (2002); Wang G.P., Defining functional signatures of dysbiosis in periodontitis progression, Genome Med, 7, (2015); Deas D.E., Moritz A.J., Sagun R.S., Et al., Scaling and root planing vs. conservative surgery in the treatment of chronic periodontitis, Periodontol 2000, 71, pp. 128-139, (2016); Beck J.D., Offenbacher S., The association between periodontal diseases and cardiovascular diseases: a state-of-the-science review, Ann Periodontol, 6, pp. 9-15, (2001); Offenbacher S., Katz V., Fertik G., Et al., Periodontal infection as a possible risk factor for preterm low birth weight, J Periodontol, 6710Suppl, pp. 1103-1113, (1996); Scannapieco F.A., Cantos A., Oral inflammation and infection, and chronic medical diseases: implications for the elderly, Periodontol 2000, 72, pp. 153-175, (2016); Khalighinejad N., Aminoshariae M.R., Aminoshariae A., Et al., Association between systemic diseases and apical periodontitis, J Endod, 42, pp. 1427-1434, (2016); Hayes C., Sparrow D., Cohen M., Et al., The association between alveolar bone loss and pulmonary function: the VA Dental Longitudinal Study, Ann Periodontol, 3, pp. 257-261, (1998); Fitzpatrick S.G., Katz J., The association between periodontal disease and cancer: a review of the literature, J Dent, 38, pp. 83-95, (2010); Chung S.D., Tsai M.C., Huang C.C., Et al., A population-based study on the associations between chronic periodontitis and the risk of cancer, Int J Clin Oncol, 21, pp. 219-223, (2016); Galvao-Moreira L.V., da Cruz M.C., Oral microbiome, periodontitis and risk of head and neck cancer.

Tooth loss and periodontal disease (PD) have been implicated to increase the risk of developing various cancers. The aim of this systematic review was to assess any possible association between PD and OC. Indexed databases were searched using different combinations of the following key words: ""oral cancer"", ""periodontal disease"", ""tooth loss"", ""squamous cell carcinoma"", ""missing teeth"" ""alveolar bone loss"", ""clinical attachment loss"" and ""periodontitis"". PRISMA criteria were followed to accrue data and databases were searched from 1984 up to and including June 2015. In total, 12 case-control studies were selected from the published literature. Results: Nine studies reported a 2-5 fold increase in the risk of OC among patients with PD as compared to those without PD. Three studies reported no association between PD and OC. In one study, an increased risk of tongue cancer was associated with each millimeter of alveolar bone loss and in two studies clinical attachment loss of more than 1.5. mm was associated with an increased risk of OC. In studies reporting significant findings these associations persisted after adjusting for major risk factors. PD is associated with a small but significant increase in risk for OC. In several reported studies this association was attenuated following adjustment for tobacco and alcohol use. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Chronic inflammation; Missing teeth; Oral cancer; Periodontal disease; Squamous cell carcinoma; Tooth loss","Humans; Mouth Neoplasms; Periodontal Diseases; Risk Factors; alcohol consumption; alveolar bone loss; cancer risk; case control study; chronic inflammation; disease association; human; medical literature; mouth cancer; mouth hygiene; outcome assessment; periodontal disease; publication; Review; risk assessment; systematic review; tobacco use; complication; Mouth Neoplasms; periodontal disease; risk factor","","","","","","","Ahn J., Chen C.Y., Hayes R.B., Oral microbiome and oral and gastrointestinal cancer risk, Cancer Causes Control: CCC, 23, pp. 399-404, (2012); Ansai T., Takata Y., Yoshida A., Soh I., Awano S., Hamasaki T., Et al., Association between tooth loss and orodigestive cancer mortality in an 80-year-old community-dwelling Japanese population: a 12-year prospective study, BMC Public Health, 13, (2013); Balkwill F., Mantovani A., Inflammation and cancer: back to virchow?, Lancet, 357, pp. 539-545, (2001); Balkwill F., Tumor necrosis factor or tumor promoting factor?, Cytokine Growth Factor Rev., 13, pp. 135-141, (2002); Beltran-Aguilar E.D., Eke P.I., Thornton-Evans G., Petersen P.E., Recording and surveillance systems for periodontal diseases, Periodontology, 60, pp. 40-53, (2012); Bergstrom J., Tobacco smoking and chronic destructive periodontal disease, Odontology, 92, pp. 1-8, (2004); Bharti P., Katagiri S., Nitta H., Nagasawa T., Kobayashi H., Takeuchi Y., Et al., Periodontal treatment with topical antibiotics improves glycemic control in association with elevated serum adiponectin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, Obesity Res.

Periodontal disease, a chronic inflammatory condition, is highly prevalent in adult populations around the world, and may be preventable. Estimates of prevalence vary between races and geographic regions, with a marked increase in the occurrence of periodontal disease with advancing age. Worldwide estimates for the prevalence of severe periodontal disease generally range from 10 to 15%. The relationship between oral health and cancer has been examined for a number of specific cancer sites. Several studies have reported associations between periodontal disease or tooth loss and risk of oral, upper gastrointestinal, lung, and pancreatic cancer in different populations. In a number of studies, these associations persisted after adjustment for major risk factors, including cigarette smoking and socioeconomic status. This review provides a summary of these findings, discusses possible biological mechanisms involved, and raises methodological issues related to studying these relationships. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cancer;

Method: Children aged 3 to 12 years old of both genders participated in the study. Thirty-two had some type of neoplasia and 30 were healthy controls. The patients were evaluated based on the following indexes: DMFT, dmft, Plaque index (PI) and Gingival index (GI) before and 6 months after the beginning of this study. Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon tests were used in the statistical analysis to check the relations among the variables (α=0.05). Results: The most frequent neoplasia was leukemia and chemotherapy was the most common type of treatment. The dental caries indexes (DMFT and dmft) increased in both groups from baseline to the 6-month evaluation, but the difference was statistically significant only for the cancer patients. For PI and GI, no statistically significant differences were observed between the groups or between two evaluation moments. Conclusion: The results reinforce the importance of including a pediatric dentist in the multiprofessional team that treats pediatric cancer patients in order to instruct, diagnose and prevent the main oral manifestations associated with neoplasias and the treatment.","Caries; Childhood cancer; Gingivitis; Oncology","","","","","","","","Vargas l., Cancer en pediatria: Aspectos generales, Rev Chil Pediatr, 71, 4, pp. 123-132, (2000); Health Topics; Medeiros E.B., Carvalho D.S.S., Gominho I.F., Quintas C.L., Rodrigues M.J., Manifestações bucais em crianças submetidas a tratamento antineoplásico no centro oncológico do Hospital Universitário Oswaldo Cruz, J Bras Odontopediatr Odontol Bebê, 5, 28, pp. 476-483, (2002); Hespanhol F.J., Tinoco E.M., Teixeira H.G.C., Falabela M.E.V., Assis N.M.S.P., Manifestações bucais em pacientes submetidos à quimioterapia, Cienc & Saúde Coletiva, 15, 1 SUPPL., pp. 1085-1099, (2010); Camargo J.D., Batistella F.I.D., Ferreira S.L.M., Complicações bucais imediatas do tratamento oncológico infantil: Identificação, prevenção e tratamento, J Bras Odontopediatr Odontol Bebê, 7, 36, pp. 177-184, (2004); Barbosa A.M., Ribeiro D.M., Teixeira A.S.C., Conhecimento e práticas em saúde bucal com crianças hospitalizadas com câncer, Ciência E Saúde Coletiva, 15, 1 SUPPL., pp. 1113-1122, (2010); Frazao C.O.B., Alfaia T.A., Costa R.C., Rocha M.L., Gouveia C.V.D., Morais A.P., Pacientes oncológicos pediátricos: Manifestações bucais da terapia antineoplásica, Rev Saúde E Pesquisa, 5, 3, pp. 559-564, (2012); Costa E.M.M.B., Fernandes M.Z., Quindere L.B., Souza I.B., Pinto I.P., Evaluation of an oral preventive protocol in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Pesqui Odontol Bras, 17, 2, pp. 147-150, (2003); Klein H., Palmer C.E., Dental caries in american indian children, Public Health Bull, 23, 9, pp. 123-129, (1938); Grubbel A.O., A measurement of dental caries prevalence and treatment service for deciduos teeth, J Dent Res, 23, 6, pp. 163-168, (1944); Loe H., The gingival index, the plaque index and the retention index systems, J.

Materials and Methods: A total of 200 individuals were interviewed and underwent an oral clinical examination, and 64 of them were suffered from several histological types of lung cancer. The estimation of the possible associations between lung cancer as a dependent variable and periodontal disease indices as independent ones was carried out by using a multiple regression analysis model. Results: Probing pocket depth (odds ratio (OR) = 2.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-7.06), clinical attachment loss (OR = 3.51, 95% CI 1.30-9.47) bleeding on probing (OR = 1.93, 95% CI 0.98-3.81) were significantly associated with the risk of developing lung cancer. Smoking (OR = 2.49, 95% CI 1.20-5.17) was significantly associated with the mentioned risk, whereas it was consisted as a confounder regarding the estimated associations between moderate/severe clinical attachment loss and presence of bleeding on probing with the risk of developing lung cancer. Conclusion: Probing pocket depth as an index for periodontal disease severity was statistically significantly associated with the risk of developing lung cancer.","Adults; Chronic inflammation; Lung cancer;

In this work, we performed a meta-analysis to ascertain the relationship between PD and HNC risk.Methods:We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for relevant observational studies on the association between PD and HNC risk published up to March 23, 2013. Data from the included studies were extracted and analyzed independently by two authors. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.2 software.Results:We obtained seven observational studies involving two cohort and six case-control studies. Random-effects meta-analysis indicated a significant association between PD and HNC risk (odds ratio = 2.63, 95% confidence interval = 1.1.68 - 4.14; p < 0.001), with sensitivity analysis showing that the result was robust. Subgroup analyses based on adjustment for covariates, study design, PD assessment, tumor site, and ethnicity also revealed a significant association.Conclusions:Based on currently evidence, PD is probably a significant and independent risk factor of HNC. © 2013 Zeng et al.","","Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Observational Study as Topic; Odds Ratio; Periodontal Diseases; Risk Factors; Sensitivity and Specificity; article; cancer risk; case control study; cohort analysis; computer program; covariance; cross-sectional study; disease association; ethnicity; head and neck cancer; human; observational study; periodontal disease; sensitivity analysis; study design; tumor localization; complication; Head and Neck Neoplasms; meta analysis; Periodontal Diseases; risk; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity","","","RevMan 5.2, Review Manager, Denmark","Review Manager, Denmark","","","Mehanna H., Paleri V., West C.M., Nutting C., Head and neck cancer--Part 1: Epidemiology, presentation, and prevention, BMJ, 341, (2010); Jemal A., Siegel R., Ward E., Hao Y., Xu J., Et al., Cancer statistics, 2008, CA Cancer J Clin, 58, pp. 71-96, (2008); Conway D.I., Hashibe M., Boffetta P., Et al., Enhancing epidemiologic research on head and neck cancer: INHANCE - The international head and neck cancer epidemiology consortium, Oral Oncol, 45, pp. 743-746, (2009); Albandar J.M., Brunelle J.A., Kingman A., Destructive periodontal disease in adults 30 years of age and older in the United States, 1988-1994, J Periodontol, 70, pp. 13-29, (1999); Pihlstrom B.L., Michalowicz B.S., Johnson N.W., Periodontal diseases, Lancet, 366, pp. 1809-1820, (2005); Cullinan M.P., Ford P.J., Seymour G.J., Periodontal disease and systemic health: current status, Aust Dent J, 54, SUPPL. 1, (2009); Blaizot A., Vergnes J.N., Nuwwareh S., Amar J., Sixou M., Periodontal diseases and cardiovascular events: meta-analysis of observational studies, Int Dent J, 59, pp. 197-209, (2009); Preshaw P.M., Alba A.L., Herrera D., Jepsen S., Konstantinidis A., Et al., Periodontitis and diabetes: a two-way relationship, Diabetologia, 55, pp. 21-31, (2012); Zeng X.T., Tu M.L., Liu D.Y., Zheng D., Zhang J., Et al., Periodontal disease and risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a meta-analysis of observational studies, PLOS ONE, 7, (2012); Corbella S., Taschieri S., Francetti L., De Siena F., Del Fabbro M., Periodontal disease as a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies, Odontology, 100, pp. 232-240, (2012); Coussens L.M., Werb Z., Inflammation and cancer, Nature, 420, pp. 860-867, (2002); Tezal M., Grossi S.G., Genco R.J., Is periodontitis associated with oral neoplasms?, J Periodontol, 76, pp. 406-410, (2005); Rosenquist K., Wennerberg J., Schildt E.B., Bladstrom A., Goran Hansson B., Et al., Oral status, oral infections and some lifestyle factors as risk factors for oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

This pilot study aimed to determine whether the severity of oral mucositis is associated with the severity of periodontitis in cancer patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy. Materials and methods: In this pilot study, 41 patients met the inclusion criteria. The severity of oral mucositis was measured according to the WHO system. The severity of periodontitis was assessed clinically and radiographically. Gingival crevicular fluid was sampled and levels of eight cytokines were determined using a multiplexed bead immunoassay. Associations between radiation-induced oral mucositis and periodontitis were analysed using logistic and linear regression. Results: There was a trend towards a greater proportion of periodontitis patients in the mucositis groups (grades=1-4) than in the non-mucositis group (grade=0). However, due to the small sample size of this pilot study, these trends were not statistically significant. Conclusion: This pilot study did not demonstrate a positive statistical correlation between periodontitis experience and severity of radiation-induced oral mucositis. Nonetheless, a trend towards increased bone loss, pocket depth and clinical attachment levels was noted in patients with mucositis grades 1-4. Larger studies with more stringent inclusion criteria are now required to further investigate this possible relationship between periodontitis experience and severity of radiation-induced oral mucositis. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.","Inflammation; Oral mucositis; Periodontitis; Radiation","Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Periodontitis; Pilot Projects; Prospective Studies; Radiation Injuries; Stomatitis; antibiotic agent; antihypertensive agent; antineoplastic agent; cytokine; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; oral antidiabetic agent; adult; aged; antibiotic therapy; article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; clinical article; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; controlled study; conventional fractionation; disease severity; female; gingivitis; head and neck cancer; human; immunoassay; intensity modulated radiation therapy; linear regression analysis; logistic regression analysis; male; multimodality cancer therapy; oral mucositis; periodontitis; pilot study; priority journal; prospective study; radiation dose fractionation; radiation injury; radiodiagnosis; sample size; world health organization","","","","","Australian Dental Research Foundation, ADRF","Acknowledgments This study was supported in part by a grant from the Australian Dental Research Foundation.

Studies implicated CP as one of the etiologies in coronary heart disease (CHD). Cardiotoxicity is a major complication of anticancer drugs, including anthracyclines and 5-fluorouracil (5FU). The most severe cardiac complications are heart failure, arrhythmia and coronary heart disease (CHD). In this study, we compared the level of inflammatory factors and cardiac markers between chronic periodontitis patients and cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. 108 blood samples of periodontally healthy subjects were obtained on random from Hong Kong Red Cross, and these represented the controlled population. Forty-four patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis were recruited from the West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University. They have received scaling and root planning with mean pocket depths of 6.05 mm. Thirty breast cancer patients diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma from UNIMED Medical Institute, Hong Kong gave consent to participate in this study. They received 4 cycles of 500mg/m2 5-fluorouracil, 75 mg/m2 epirubicin and 500mg/m2 cyclophosphamide at a 3-week interval between each cycle. Peripheral venous blood from each group was taken for measurement of blood cells, inflammatory marker (P-selectin, high sensitvity C-reactive protein) and cardiac markers (troponin T; troponin I; N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (Nt-proBNP) and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The lymphocyte count was higher (p < 0.05) in periodontitis patients than the other two groups, and more neutrophils (p < 0.05) were seen in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. The two test groups demonstrated higher levels (p < 0.01) of inflammatory and cardiac markers than the control group. The elevated cardiac markers found in periodontitis patients suggested that they may carry potential risks in developing cardiac lesions. Troponin T, troponin I, pro-BNP, LDH and high sensitvity C-reactive protein may be used as markers to monitor cardiac lesions in chronic inflammatory patients.","","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Biological Markers; Breast Neoplasms; Case-Control Studies; Chronic Periodontitis; Female; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardium; Young Adult; autacoid; biological marker; adolescent; adult; aged; article; blood; breast tumor; case control study; chronic periodontitis; comparative study; female; heart muscle; human; male; metabolism; middle aged","","Biological Markers, ; Inflammation Mediators, ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","14795876","","","23046680","English","J Transl Med","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84877655798"

Periodontal disease in head and neck cancer patients treated with radiation therapy may lead to acute and chronic complications. The literature was reviewed by a search of Medline of the National Library of Medicine. The search was conducted to identify publications assessing periodontal disease in cancer patients. In addition, a review of papers referenced in the retrieved papers was conducted to identify additional publications for review. Periodontal disease should be assessed and managed prior to medical treatment of cancer for those with oropharyngeal cancer, and for patients in whom neutropenia may develop during treatment. Pretreatment assessment and management, and maintenance of oral hygiene have been shown to be effective in preventing oral and systemic complications during treatment. A complete oral and periodontal examination is appropriate for all patients planned to receive head and neck radiation therapy and those to be treated with medical protocols that are anticipated to result in neutropenia. Oral and periodontal care must continue following cancer therapy, and requires that the health care provider have an understanding of the malignant disease, oral manifestations of the disease, medical management of the disease, and of the oral complications that may develop. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We aimed to assess whether periodontal disease or tooth loss is associated with cancer risk. Methods: The analysis was done in a prospective study (the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study [HPFS]), which was initiated in 1986 when US male health professionals aged 40-75 years responded to questionnaires posted by the Department of Nutrition, Harvard University School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA. In addition to the baseline questionnaires, follow-up questionnaires were posted to all living participants every 2 years and dietary questionnaires every 4 years. At baseline, participants were asked whether they had a history of periodontal disease with bone loss. Participants also reported number of natural teeth at baseline and any tooth loss during the previous 2 years was reported on the follow-up questionnaires. Smoking status and history of smoking were obtained at baseline and in all subsequent questionnaires. Additionally at baseline, participants reported their mean frequency of food intake over the previous year on a 131-item semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Participants reported any new cancer diagnosis on the follow-up questionnaires. Endpoints for this study were risk of total cancer and individual cancers with more than 100 cases. Multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were calculated by use of Cox proportional hazard models according to periodontal disease status and number of teeth at baseline. Findings: In the main analyses, 48 375 men with median follow-up of 17·7 years (1986 to Jan 31, 2004) were eligible after excluding participants diagnosed with cancer before 1986 (other than non-melanoma skin cancer, n=2076) and those with missing data on periodontal disease (n=1078). 5720 incident cancer cases were documented (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer and non-aggressive prostate cancer). The five most common cancers were colorectal (n=1043), melanoma of the skin (n=698), lung (n=678), bladder (n=543), and advanced prostate (n=541). After adjusting for known risk factors, including detailed smoking history and dietary factors, participants with a history of periodontal disease had an increased risk of total cancer (HR 1·14 [95% CI 1·07-1·22]) compared with those with no history of periodontal disease. By cancer site, significant associations for those with a history of peridontal disease were noted for lung (1·36 [1·15-1·60]), kidney (1·49 [1·12-1·97]), pancreas (1·54 [1·16-2·04]; findings previously published), and haematological cancers (1·30 [1·11-1·53]). Fewer teeth at baseline (0-16) was associated with an increase in risk of lung cancer (1·70 [1·37-2·11]) for those with 0-16 teeth versus those with 25-32 teeth. In never-smokers, periodontal disease was associated with significant increases in total (1·21 [1·06-1·39]) and haematological cancers (1·35 [1·01-1·81]). By contrast, no association was noted for lung cancer (0·96 [0·46-1·98]). Interpretation: Periodontal disease was associated with a small, but significant, increase in overall cancer risk, which persisted in never-smokers. The associations recorded for lung cancer are probably because of residual confounding by smoking. The increased risks noted for haematological, kidney, and pancreatic cancers need confirmation, but suggest that periodontal disease might be a marker of a susceptible immune system or might directly affect cancer risk.

This study aimed to investigate the subsequent risk for cancers among subjects with CP. Methods: This study cohort included 40,140 subjects with CP and 40,140 subjects who were matched for a comparison cohort. We individually tracked each patient for a 5-year period following their index date to identify those who had received a diagnosis of cancer. Results: The incidence rate of cancer during the 5-year follow-up period was 14.80 (95 % CI 14.28–15.34) per 1,000 person-years in subjects with CP. Cox proportional hazards regression revealed that the hazard ratio of cancer during the 5-year follow-up period for subjects with CP was 1.23 (95 % CI 1.20–1.27) compared to that of the comparison cohort. Conclusion: We observed an increased risk for the subsequent development of a number of cancers among subjects with CP. © 2015, Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.","Cancer; Chronic periodontitis; Epidemiology","Adult; Case-Control Studies; Chronic Periodontitis; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan; adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer incidence; cancer risk; chronic periodontitis; cohort analysis; controlled study; digestive system cancer; disease association; female; follow up; gingivectomy; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mouth cancer; periodontal flap; population research; priority journal; Taiwan; tissue flap; urogenital tract cancer; case control study; chronic periodontitis; complication; incidence; Neoplasms; prognosis; proportional hazards model; randomized controlled trial; retrospective study; risk factor","","","","","","","Friedewald V.E., Kornman K.S., Beck J.D., Et al., The American Journal of Cardiology and Journal of Periodontology Editors’ consensus: periodontitis and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, Am J Cardiol, 104, pp. 59-68, (2009); Pihlstrom B.L., Michalowicz B.S., Johnson N.W., Periodontal diseases, Lancet, 366, pp. 1809-1820, (2005); Amabile N., Susini G., Pettenati-Soubayroux I., Et al., Severity of periodontal disease correlates to inflammatory systemic status and independently predicts the presence and angiographic extent of stable coronary artery disease, J Intern Med, 263, pp. 644-652, (2008); Abnet C.C., Qiao Y.L., Mark S.D., Et al., Prospective study of tooth loss and incident esophageal and gastric cancers in China, Cancer Causes Control, 12, pp. 847-854, (2001); Loos B.G., Systemic markers of inflammation in periodontitis, J Periodontal, 76, pp. 2106-2115, (2005); Joshipura K.J., Wand H.C., Merchant A.T., Et al., Periodontal disease and biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease, J Dent Res, 83, pp. 151-155, (2004); Moutsopoulos N.M., Madianos P.N., Low-grade inflammation in chronic infectious diseases: paradigm of periodontal infections, Ann N Y Acad Sci, 1088, pp. 251-264, (2006); DeStefano F., Anda R.F., Kahn H.S., Et al., Dental disease and risk of coronary heart disease and mortality, BMJ, 306, pp. 688-691, (1993); Wu T., Trevisan M., Genco R.J., Dorn J.P., Et al., Periodontal disease and risk of cerebrovascular diseasethe first national health and nutrition examination survey and its follow-up study, Arch Intern Med, 160, pp. 2749-2755, (2000); Coussens L.M., Werb Z., Inflammation and cancer, Nature, 420, pp. 860-867, (2002); Yao S.G., Fine J.B., Periodontitis and cancer… a link?

The case group comprised 35 patients (mean age 56.1±8.4), diagnosed for oral and/or oropharyngeal cancer. The control group comprised 40 individuals (mean age 55.4±9.4) without diagnostic of cancer. All individuals were subjected to a periodontal examination, including bleeding on probing, plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), and decayed, extracted and filled teeth index (DMFT). The case group had significantly more sites with plaque. GI and BOP had similar values in both groups. The median PPD and CAL values were significantly higher for the case group. Chronic generalized periodontitis was predominant in 80% of patients with oral and/or oropharyngeal cancer. Eighty nine percent of the patients in the case group presented severe chronic periodontitis. There was no significant difference between groups for median values of DMFT. The extent and severity of chronic periodontitis remained as risk indicators for oral cavity and/or oropharyngeal cancer even after the adjustments for traditional confound factors, i.e. smoking and alcohol consumption. © 2016, Associacao Brasileira de Divulgacao Cientifica.

This retrospective cohort study examined the association between PD severity and CRC in a large-scale, population-based Chinese cohort. Methods: A total of approximately 106,487 individuals with newly diagnosed PD and 106,487 age-matched and sex-matched patients without PD from 2000 to 2002 were identified from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Results: The Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that the cumulative incidence of CRC was significantly higher in patients with PD than in those without PD (log-rank test, P < 0.001). After adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities, patients with PD were associated with a significantly higher risk of CRC compared with those without PD (adjusted HR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.50–1.80). Further, the risk of CRC appeared to increase with increasing frequency of PD medical visits [adjusted HR (95% CI) was 1.78 (1.58–2.02) and 1.53 (1.35–1.74) for annual visits > 10 and < 4, respectively]. Conclusion: Based on our study, PD severity was associated with an increase in the risk of CRC. Further mechanistic research is needed. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Colorectal cancer (CRC); National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD); Periodontal disease (PD); Retrospective cohort study","Adult; Cohort Studies; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Periodontal Diseases; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; adult; Article; cancer incidence; chi square test; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; comorbidity; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; national health insurance; periodontal disease; population research; priority journal; retrospective study; risk assessment; colorectal tumor; complication; Kaplan Meier method; pathology; periodontal disease; risk factor; severity of illness index","","","","","Chi-Mei Hospital; Fu Jen Catholic University, FJCU, (105-CM-FJU-09)","Funding information This study was supported by a grant from the Chi-Mei Hospital and Fu Jen Catholic University (105-CM-FJU-09).","Momen-Heravi F., Babic A., Tworoger S.S., Zhang L., Wu K., Smith-Warner S.A., Ogino S., Chan A.T., Meyerhardt J., Giovannucci E., Fuchs C., Cho E., Michaud D.S., Stampfer M.J., Yu Y.H., Kim D., Zhang X., Periodontal disease, tooth loss and colorectal cancer risk: results from the Nurses’ Health Study, Int J Cancer, 140, 3, pp. 646-652, (2017); Soory M., Oxidative stress induced mechanisms in the progression of periodontal diseases and cancer: a common approach to redox homeostasis?, Cancers, 2, 2, pp. 670-692, (2010); Ray K., Colorectal cancer: Fusobacterium nucleatum found in colon cancer tissue—could an infection cause colorectal cancer?, Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol, 8, 12, (2011); Sears C.L., Garrett W.S., Microbes, microbiota, and colon cancer, Cell Host Microbe, 15, 3, pp. 317-328, (2014); Tahara T., Yamamoto E., Suzuki H., Maruyama R., Chung W., Garriga J., Jelinek J., Yamano H.O., Sugai T., An B., Shureiqi I., Toyota M., Kondo Y., Estecio M.R., Issa J.P., Fusobacterium in colonic flora and molecular features of colorectal carcinoma, Cancer Res, 74, 5, pp. 1311-1318, (2014); Mima K., Sukawa Y., Nishihara R., Qian Z.R., Yamauchi M., Inamura K., Kim S.A., Masuda A., Nowak J.A., Nosho K., Kostic A.D., Giannakis M., Watanabe H., Bullman S., Milner D.A., Harris C.C., Giovannucci E., Garraway L.A., Freeman G.J., Dranoff G., Chan A.T., Garrett W.S., Huttenhower C., Fuchs C.S., Ogino S., Fusobacterium nucleatum and T cells in colorectal carcinoma, JAMA Oncol, 1, 5, pp. 653-661, (2015); Williams R.C., Periodontal disease, N Engl J Med, 322, 6, pp. 373-382, (1990); Kostic A.D., Chun E., Robertson L., Glickman J.N., Gallini C.A., Michaud M., Clancy T.E., Chung D.C., Lochhead P., Hold G.L., El-Omar E.M., Brenner D., Fuchs C.S., Meyerson M., Garrett W.S., Fusobacterium nucleatum potentiates intestinal tumorigenesis and modulates the tumor-immune microenvironment, Cell Host Microbe, 14, 2, pp. 207-215, (2013); Schwabe R.F., Jobin C., The microbiome and cancer, Nat Rev Cancer, 13, 11, pp. 800-812, (2013); Shimizu T., Marusawa H., Endo Y., Chiba T., Inflammation-mediated genomic instability: roles of activation-induced cytidine deaminase in carcinogenesis, Cancer Sci, 103, 7, pp. 1201-1206, (2012); Kostic A.D., Gevers D., Pedamallu C.S., Michaud M., Duke F., Earl A.M., Ojesina A.I., Jung J., Bass A.J., Tabernero J., Baselga J., Liu C., Shivdasani R.A., Ogino S., Birren B.W., Huttenhower C., Garrett W.S., Meyerson M., Genomic analysis identifies association of Fusobacterium with colorectal carcinoma, Genome Res, 22, 2, pp. 292-298, (2012); Warren R.L., Freeman D.J., Pleasance S., Watson P., Moore R.A., Cochrane K., Allen-Vercoe E., Holt R.A., Co-occurrence of anaerobic bacteria in colorectal carcinomas, Microbiome, 1, 1, (2013)","C.-A.

Methods Two reviewers independently screened electronic and manual sources for pertinent articles. Primary outcome measures were the occurrence of neoplasm diagnosis in exposed and non-exposed groups, reported to evaluate association between cancer and periodontitis. Results Of the 490 initially retrieved papers 10 were included in the qualitative synthesis and eight in the quantitative synthesis; the eight papers covered six studies. Considering hazard ratios, a statistically significant association was found for all cancers studied (1.14; CI 95%: 1.04, 1.24), digestive tract cancer (1.34; CI 95%: 1.05, 1.72), pancreatic cancer (1.74; CI 95%: 1.21, 2.52), prostate cancer (1.25; CI 95%: 1.04, 1.51), breast cancer (1.11; CI 95%: 1.00, 1.23), corpus uteri cancer (2.20; CI 95%: 1.16, 4.18), lung cancer (1.24; CI 95%: 1.06, 1.45), hematological cancer (1.30; CI 95%: 1.11, 1.53), esophagus / oropharyngeal cancer pooled together (2.25; CI 95%: 1.30, 3.90) and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (1.30; CI 95%: 1.11, 1.52). Conclusions Despite the sparse scientific evidence and considering the low statistical power of the results, this systematic review revealed a substantial lack of studies with standardized and comparable methods to speculate about the association between periodontitis and cancer; more studies are need in order to explore further the scientific evidence of such correlation. © 2018 Corbella et al.

Materials and Methods: PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases were searched up to February 8, 2018 for observational studies examining the association between periodontal disease and breast cancer. Study selection was conducted according to predesigned eligibility criteria, and two authors independently extracted data from included studies. Meta-analysis was performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis v2 software and risk estimates were calculated as relative risks (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: A total of 11 study were included. Meta-analysis indicated that periodontal disease significantly increased the risk of breast cancer by 1.22-fold (RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.06-1.40). Amongst participants with periodontal patients and a history of periodontal therapy, the risk of developing breast cancer was not significant (RR = 1.23; 95% CI = 0.95-1.60). The association results between periodontal diseases and breast cancer were found to be robust, as evident in the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: Periodontal disease may be a potential risk factor for the development of breast cancer among women, and thus effective periodontal therapy may present as a valuable preventive measure against breast cancer.

We assessed these associations in a Hispanic adult population in Puerto Rico. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 735 adults assessed marijuana use, determined through an audio computer-assisted self-interview, and periodontitis and self-collection of oral HPV samples following the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey methodology. The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention/American Academy of Periodontology definition was used for periodontitis. HPV typing was performed using polymerase chain reaction with modified L1 consensus primers (MY09/MY11). Results: 26.5% of adults reported lifetime use of marijuana, 2.7% were frequent users (lifetime use ≥ 26 times, past year use ≥ 6 times, and past 30-day use ≥2 times), 5.7% had oral HPV infection, and 20.1% had severe periodontitis. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that frequent marijuana users were more likely to have severe periodontitis (OR = (2.93, 95%: 1.08–7.96)) than never/once lifetime users after adjusting for age, sex, healthcare coverage, smoking, binge drinking, number of oral sex partners, and oral HPV infection. However, frequent marijuana use was not associated with oral HPV infection. Conclusion: Marijuana use was associated with periodontitis, but not with oral HPV infection. Further evaluation of the role of marijuana use in oral HPV infection and periodontitis may inform novel preventive public health strategies, as marijuana users could be at increased risk of oral cancer. © 2018 American Academy of Periodontology","human papillomavirus; marijuana; oral cancer; periodontitis","Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Marijuana Use; Mouth Neoplasms; Nutrition Surveys; Papillomavirus Infections; Periodontitis; Prevalence; Puerto Rico; Risk Factors; adult; cannabis use; cross-sectional study; Hispanic; human; mouth tumor; nutrition; papillomavirus infection; periodontitis; prevalence; Puerto Rico; risk factor","","","","","Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology of the University of Puerto Rico Graduate School of Public Health; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR, (5R21DE024850-02); Puerto Rico Sea Grant, University of Puerto Rico, UPRSGCP; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, NIMHD, (2U54MD007587)","This study was funded by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR Grant # 5R21DE024850-02) of the National Institutes of Health.

Design: Case-control study using preexisting data from patients admitted between June 15, 1999, and November 17, 2005. Setting: Department of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Prosthetics at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI), Buffalo, NY. Patients: The cases comprised 51 non-Hispanic white men newly diagnosed as having primary squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, and the controls, 54 non-Hispanic white men evaluated during the same period but with negative results for malignancy. Children (aged <21 years), edentulous or immunocompromised patients, and those with history of any cancer were excluded. History of periodontitis was assessed by alveolar bone loss measured from panoramic radiographs by 1 examiner blind to cancer status. Main Outcome Measure: Incidence of tongue cancer obtained from the RPCI Tumor Registry. Results: After adjusting for the effects of age at diagnosis, smoking status, and number of teeth, each millimeter of alveolar bone loss was associated with a 5.23-fold increase in the risk of tongue cancer (odds ratio, 5.23; 95% confidence interval, 2.64-10.35). Conclusions: This study suggests an association between chronic periodontitis and the risk of tongue cancer in men, independent of smoking status, age, race, ethnicity, and number of teeth. This association needs to be confirmed by larger studies using quantitative assessment of lifetime tobacco exposure. If this association is confirmed, it has a potential impact on understanding the etiology of oral cancer as well as on its prevention and control. ©2007 American Medical Association.

We conducted a population-based study to evaluate the association between periodontal disease and the risk of cancer. Methods: We used insurance claims data from 1997 to 2010, accessing a database of 1 million randomly selected insurants in Taiwan. All patients were older than 20 and newly diagnosed with periodontitis between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2010. The comparison cohort comprised patients older than 20, who were newly diagnosed with gingivitis in the same period. Both cohorts were followed until a cancer diagnosis, lost to follow-up, death, termination of insurance, or the end of 2010. Results: The incidence rate of cancer was 1.14 times higher in the study cohort than in the comparison cohort [confidence interval (CI) = 1.11-1.17]. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 1.05 (95% CI = 1.00-1.11). A multivariable analysis showed that the periodontitis patients exhibited an elevated risk of developing oral cancer (adjusted HR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.42-2.25). Conclusion: The findings indicated that patients in the periodontitis cohort exhibited a higher risk of developing oral cancer than those in the gingivitis cohort. © The Author 2013.

Design: Case-control study using existing patient data. Setting: Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Patients: Thirty patients newly diagnosed with base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma between 1999 and 2005 for whom both tumor samples and periodontal records were available. Patients younger than 21 years, edentulous, immunocompromised, and those with a history of cancer were excluded. Periodontitis history was assessed on the basis of alveolar bone loss (in millimeters) from panoramic radiographs by one examiner who was blinded to cancer status. Main Outcome Measure: HPV-16 and HPV-18 DNA were identified on paraffin-embedded tumor samples by polymerase chain reaction. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results: The prevalence of tumors positive for HPV-16 DNA was 21 of 30 (70%). None of the samples were positive for HPV-18 DNA. Compared with participants with HPV-negative tumors, patients with HPV-positive tumors had significantly higher mean alveolar bone loss (3.90 mm vs 2.85 mm, P=.01). After adjustment for age at diagnosis, sex, race/ethnicity, alcohol use, smoking status, and number of missing teeth, every millimeter of alveolar bone loss was associated with an approximately 4-fold (odds ratio,3.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-13.36) increased risk of HPV-positive tumor status. Number of missing teeth was not associated with tumor HPV status (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-1.21). Conclusions: Chronic periodontitis may be a significant factor in the natural history of HPV infection in patients with base of tongue cancers. Additional confirmation in larger studies is required. © 2009 American Medical Association.
