## 1. Overview 
 <br> 
 This paper investigates the relationship between periodontal disease (PD) and various cancer types. It provides a comprehensive overview of the existing knowledge about the interaction between PD and carcinogenesis, explores the underlying biological mechanisms of this connection, and consider the impact of these findings on healthcare practices and future research directions. Utilizing Systematic Literature Network Analysis (SLNA), which combines bibliometric analysis with Systematic Literature Review (SLR), our study analyzes 164 documents from 2000 to 2023. Focus is placed on the 37 most globally cited papers, enabling a targeted and comprehensive analysis of the predominant research within this scope. Our review highlights that colorectal, oral, pancreatic, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers have consistent associations with periodontal disease. On the other hand, hematological, breast and prostate cancers show associations with periodontal disease, but these links are less pronounced and more variable, indicating the need for targeted research in these domains. These insights emphasize the necessity for a multidisciplinary healthcare approach, recognizing the systemic implications of periodontal health.
